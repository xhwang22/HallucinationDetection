When he was 16 years old, his Uncle Louis bought him his first saxophone, an alto.\nMoody joined the US Army Air Corps in 1943 and played in the \"negro band\" at the segregated Greensboro Training Center.[6][7] Following his discharge from the military in 1946, he played bebop with Dizzy Gillespie[2] for two years. Moody later played with Gillespie in 1964, where his colleagues in the Gillespie group, pianist Kenny Barron and guitarist Les Spann, would be musical collaborators in the coming decades.\n\nIn 1948, he recorded for Blue Note, his first session in a long recording career playing both saxophone and flute. That same year he relocated to Europe, where he stayed for three years, saying he had been \"scarred by racism\" in the U.S.[7] His European work, including the first recording of \"Moody's Mood for Love\", which became a hit in 1952,[8] saw him add the alto saxophone to his repertoire and helped to establish him as recording artist in his own right, and formed part of the growth of European jazz. Then in 1952, he returned to the U.S. to a recording career with Prestige Records and others, playing flute and saxophone in bands that included musicians such as Pee Wee Moore and others.\n\nMoody and his Orchestra performed for the eleventh famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on July 24, 1955. Also featured Big Jay McNeely, Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra, The Medallions and The Penguins.[9]\n\nIn the 1960s, he rejoined Dizzy Gillespie. He later worked also with Mike Longo.[10]\n\nIn 1997, Moody appeared as William Glover, the law firm's porter, in Clint Eastwood's movie adaptation of John Berendt's novel Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.[11][2]\n\nIn a 1998 interview with Bob Bernotas, Moody stated that he believed jazz has definite spiritual resonance.[10]\n\nThe James Moody Quartet (with pianist Renee Rosnes, bassist Todd Coolman, and drummer Adam Nussbaum) was Moody's vehicle later in his career. Moody played regularly with Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars and the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band and also often collaborated with former Gillespie alumnus, the trumpeter-composer-conductor Jon Faddis; Faddis and Moody worked in 2007 with the WDR Big Band in Cologne, Germany under the direction of Michael Abene. And along with Faddis, toured in 1986 with the Philip Morris Superband hosting artists like Hammond organist Jimmy Smith, Kenny Burrell, Grady Tate and Barbara Morrison. Included in this line-up were Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen, Jimmy Heath, Kenny Washington, Slide Hampton and Monty Alexander on a four-country, 14-city one-month tour of 18 concerts, notably in Australia, Canada, Japan and the Philippines, starting on September 3, 1986, with its first concert in Perth, Australia. The Philip Morris Superband concept started a year previous in 1985.\n\nAwards and honors\nTwo months after his death, Moody won the Grammy Award posthumously for Best Jazz Instrumental Album for his album Moody 4B.\n\nThe New Jersey Performing Arts Center hosts the James Moody Democracy of Jazz Festival.[12][13]\n\nPersonal life\nMoody was married three times; the first two ended in divorce. His third marriage was to the former Linda Petersen McGowan, whom he married in 1989. He had a daughter, Michelle Moody Bagdanove, and through Linda, three step-sons, Regan, Danny and Patrick McGowan.[4] Moody and his wife resided in San Diego.\n\nHe was an active member of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.[10] In 2005, the Moodys established the Moody Scholarship Fund[14] at the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College-State University of New York (SUNY Purchase). Moody was awarded an NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship in 1998 and often participated in educational programming and outreach, including with the International Association for Jazz Education, or IAJE.\n\nMoody was fluent in Italian.\n\nDeath\nOn November 2, 2010, Moody's wife announced on his behalf that he had pancreatic cancer, and had chosen not to have it treated aggressively. After palliative care, Moody died in San Diego, on December 9, 2010, from complications resulting from the cancer.[2]",

        "premise": "Herbert \"Herbie\" Kronowitz, originally Theodore \"Ted\" Kronowitz (September, 1923 \u2013 November 9, 2012),[1] was an American middleweight boxer who fought in the ring from 1941 to 1950. In 1947, Kronowitz was ranked among the top ten boxers in the world. Due to his height, his boxing style favored long range attacks, using his left jab and fast feet to outmaneuver his opponents, but he could box at close range as well. After his boxing career ended, Kronowitz was a highly regarded referee for nearly thirty years from 1955 to 1984.[2] He resided in Bensonhurst, in his native Brooklyn, New York.[3]\n\nEarly life\nKronowitz was only 17 years old when he began his professional boxing career in 1941.[3]\n\nCoast Guard service\nKronowitz joined the United States Coast Guard in 1943 during the World War II era. During the war, his older brother was serving in the army in the Pacific War and his younger brother Albert was killed in the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium. As a result, Herbie was ordered to remain stateside to keep him out of combat duty.[1][2]\n\nBoxing career\nLoss to Artie Levine, March 1947\n[3] The crowd strongly protested the judges' ruling and Levine had to come from behind to take it, though all three judges favored Levine in the close scoring.  Kronowitz was fighting as a replacement in his first main event in the garden. The bout was the last main feature between two Jewish boxers at Madison Square Garden.[4][2]\nThe Castellani fight on September 5, 1947, at Madison Square Garden saw Kronowitz winning only the eighth round according to one source. Though a loss, Castellani was one of Kronowitz's best opponents and would later contend for the World Middleweight Championship in 1954. The bout showcased the Jewish boxer as a heavyweight contender, and took place before a sizable crowd of 6,800 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.[5]\n\nAThe Mead fight was one of Kronowitz's more widely publicized bouts, and Krononowitz was \"thoroughly trounced\" on September 5, 1947, at Madison Square Garden. Kronowitz lost to Mead a second time in a close fight on January 15, 1948, in another close decision at the Garden.[3][6]\n\nOn January 24, 1947, Kronowitz defeated Billy Walker, one of his more skilled competitors, in a rematch at St. Nicholas Arena in New York by a significant margin of the judge's scoring. He had apparently learned Walker's style from their previous meeting and applied the knowledge to his strategy. More potent punching led Kronowitz to the victory. Walker was awarded no more than three rounds by any of the ring officials. The referee for the bout was the great, retired Jewish lightweight boxer, Ruby Goldstein, whose career in the ring may have been cut short by the New York Jewish mob influencing his choice of opponents.[7] In Kronowitz and Walker's first bout on December 9, 1946, Kronowitz won in a somewhat close ten round split decision, also at St. Nicholas. Kronowitz completed his sweep of Walker with an eight-round win on April 23, 1949, in a less well publicized bout in Brooklyn.\n\nOn May 2, 1947, Kronowitz fought Sonny Horne at New York's St. Nicholas Arena, winning in a ten-round unanimous decision. Horne, an Ohio resident, was a prolific and respected middleweight. Both boxers completed near the 160 pound mark.[8]\n\nWin over Harold Green at New York's Ebbet's Field, June 1947\nKronowitz defeated fellow Jewish boxer Harold Green before a riveted crowd of around 12,000 on June 14, 1947, at Ebbet's Field in New York. Ebbets Field, the beloved home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was the inevitable choice for the bout that drew a sizable crowd from Brooklyn's Jewish community. In a ten-round unanimous decision, Kronowitz took what some reporters called the \"Middleweight Championship of Brooklyn\" as both participants were well known Brooklyn natives.[2] It was a close fight, though the points decision reflected the official's agreement that Kronowitz had thrown more punches.[9] Kronowitz won the bout largely by his long range boxing, whereas Green dominated the infighting. With an inferior reach, Green dominated the infighting, but Kronowitz put up an excellent defense, using his reach to confine most of Greens well-connected blows to his midsection. Though Kronowitz had only an inch advantage in height over Green, he seemed to use his slight reach advantage effectively and succeeded in keeping most of the fighting at long range. His left was his most effective weapon against his opponent. As in other bouts, Kronowitz was able to use his longer reach to deliver harder punches, particularly at long range.[10]\n\nOn August 4, 1947, Kronowitz defeated fellow Brooklyn middleweight Jerry Fiorello by a convincing number of judges points at Queensboro Arena in Queens in an eight-round unanimous decision. It was his sixth straight win, and pushed Kronowitz higher in the world welterweight rankings.[11][12]\n\nOn November 28, 1947, he fought LaVerne Roach, one of his better opponents, at New York's St. Nicholas Arena before an enthusiastic crowd of 3000. Kronowitz lost in a very close ten round unanimous decision, in which both boxers remained upright throughout. Though Kronowitz proved to be the stronger puncher, rocking his opponent in the first and fifth rounds, Roach, the skilled recently discharged Marine boxer, showed better ringcraft, stamina, and technique. Roach threw more punches focusing more on the midsection of Kronowitz, who appeared to lack a strong defense in that area. An exceptionally trained boxer, Roach lost only one of 48 bouts while fighting for the Marines, and was considered one of the best fighters they had developed during the war.[3][13]\n\nOn August 11, 1949, Kronowitz defeated Vinnie Cidone in a main event ten round split decision at Hamilton Arena in Brooklyn, New York. Cidone was 27, and would have a modest career as a local boxer, fighting the majority of his bouts in the Brooklyn area.[3]\n\nBoxing decline 1949-50\nOn September 26, 1949, Kronowitz was sanctioned for his \"poor performance\" against Lee Sala in a ten-round unanimous decision that went against him at McNearney Stadium in Schenectady, New York. The 30 day sanction was for the lack of action in the fight. The judges went strongly in favor of Sala.[14][15]\n\nOne of Kronowitz's better performances in a loss was against well rated Syrian opponent Charley Zivic before a crowd of 15,097 at Madison Square Garden on February 13, 1948, in a ten-round points decision. Kronowitz fought best in the third and the seventh, though suffering from a cut nose from a previous bout. Zivic used his left more effectively in the bout, and Zivic was usually unable to defend against it. Zivic appeared to have injured his thumb in the eighth, and likely suffered from a reduced point score in the final rounds. Though a significant advantage in scoring was held by Zivic at the end, there were no knockdowns in the fight, a tribute to Kronowitz's endurance and ring craft.[16][17]\n\nOn October 28, 1949, Kronowitz faced Jimmy Flood losing in a unanimous ten-round decision before a crowd of 13,000, who had come to see a vicious feature fight featuring featherweight Sandy Saddler. It was Kronowitz's last appearance at New York's Madison Square Garden. Flood, at only 20, had a large and vocal following in New York. With a constant two-fisted body attack, Flood wore down his opponent as the boxers slugged away in a give and take fashion through most of the fight. Though both boxers were very near the 160 middleweight mark, Kronowitz was seven years older than his rival, and the constant battering he had taken in his ten years as a professional was likely the critical factor in the outcome of the fight. The audience responded to the unanimous decision with both boos and cheering. Flood was on a considerable winning streak before facing Kronowitz and had lost only one bout in his busy two years of professional fighting. He was far younger and had fought far fewer battles than the ring veteran Kronowitz.[18]\n\nIn what was one of his last high billing fights on December 12, 1949, Johnny Greco outpointed Kronowitz in a ten-round unanimous decision at the Forum in Montreal, Canada.\n\nOn March 31, 1950, Kronowitz lost a bout by knockout to Bobby Hughes in Toledo, Ohio, 1:50 into the third round. On May 29, 1950, Kronowitz faced Joey De John at the State Fair Coliseum in Syracuse, New York. He was knocked out 2:11 into the first round by his opponent. De John was one of the more skilled opponents Kronowitz met at the end of his career, but his performance likely pushed him to retire. The Hughes bout was the end of a six bout losing streak for Herbie, and though he had faced several quality opponents near the end of his career, he realized his time in the ring had come to an end.[3]\n\nLife after boxing, 1950\nShortly after his retirement, Kronowitz purchased two New York City taxi medallions in 1950 and worked as a taxi driver.[2]\n\nLater, he worked as a referee for the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) for twenty nine years from 1955 to 1984. He was greatly respected and used the easy grace he gained from his years as a boxer to move quickly around the ring and take in every aspect of the bouts he refereed. He was considered an impartial and capable official.[3][2]\n\nKeeping a presence in the boxing world, he became a member of the \"Ring 8\" board of directors and an active member of the Veteran's Boxing Association.[3][2]\n\nHe was featured in 2007 in a Jewish exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street in Manhattan.\n\nKronowitz died November 9, 2012, in Brooklyn at the age of eighty-nine.",

With an inferior reach, Green dominated the infighting, but Kronowitz put up an excellent defense, using his reach to confine most of Greens well-connected blows to his midsection. Though Kronowitz had only an inch advantage in height over Green, he seemed to use his slight reach advantage effectively and succeeded in keeping most of the fighting at long range. His left was his most effective weapon against his opponent. As in other bouts, Kronowitz was able to use his longer reach to deliver harder punches, particularly at long range.[10]\n\nOn August 4, 1947, Kronowitz defeated fellow Brooklyn middleweight Jerry Fiorello by a convincing number of judges points at Queensboro Arena in Queens in an eight-round unanimous decision. It was his sixth straight win, and pushed Kronowitz higher in the world welterweight rankings.[11][12]\n\nOn November 28, 1947, he fought LaVerne Roach, one of his better opponents, at New York's St. Nicholas Arena before an enthusiastic crowd of 3000. Kronowitz lost in a very close ten round unanimous decision, in which both boxers remained upright throughout. Though Kronowitz proved to be the stronger puncher, rocking his opponent in the first and fifth rounds, Roach, the skilled recently discharged Marine boxer, showed better ringcraft, stamina, and technique. Roach threw more punches focusing more on the midsection of Kronowitz, who appeared to lack a strong defense in that area. An exceptionally trained boxer, Roach lost only one of 48 bouts while fighting for the Marines, and was considered one of the best fighters they had developed during the war.[3][13]\n\nOn August 11, 1949, Kronowitz defeated Vinnie Cidone in a main event ten round split decision at Hamilton Arena in Brooklyn, New York. Cidone was 27, and would have a modest career as a local boxer, fighting the majority of his bouts in the Brooklyn area.[3]\n\nBoxing decline 1949-50\nOn September 26, 1949, Kronowitz was sanctioned for his \"poor performance\" against Lee Sala in a ten-round unanimous decision that went against him at McNearney Stadium in Schenectady, New York. The 30 day sanction was for the lack of action in the fight. The judges went strongly in favor of Sala.[14][15]\n\nOne of Kronowitz's better performances in a loss was against well rated Syrian opponent Charley Zivic before a crowd of 15,097 at Madison Square Garden on February 13, 1948, in a ten-round points decision. Kronowitz fought best in the third and the seventh, though suffering from a cut nose from a previous bout. Zivic used his left more effectively in the bout, and Zivic was usually unable to defend against it. Zivic appeared to have injured his thumb in the eighth, and likely suffered from a reduced point score in the final rounds. Though a significant advantage in scoring was held by Zivic at the end, there were no knockdowns in the fight, a tribute to Kronowitz's endurance and ring craft.[16][17]\n\nOn October 28, 1949, Kronowitz faced Jimmy Flood losing in a unanimous ten-round decision before a crowd of 13,000, who had come to see a vicious feature fight featuring featherweight Sandy Saddler. It was Kronowitz's last appearance at New York's Madison Square Garden. Flood, at only 20, had a large and vocal following in New York. With a constant two-fisted body attack, Flood wore down his opponent as the boxers slugged away in a give and take fashion through most of the fight. Though both boxers were very near the 160 middleweight mark, Kronowitz was seven years older than his rival, and the constant battering he had taken in his ten years as a professional was likely the critical factor in the outcome of the fight. The audience responded to the unanimous decision with both boos and cheering. Flood was on a considerable winning streak before facing Kronowitz and had lost only one bout in his busy two years of professional fighting. He was far younger and had fought far fewer battles than the ring veteran Kronowitz.[18]\n\nIn what was one of his last high billing fights on December 12, 1949, Johnny Greco outpointed Kronowitz in a ten-round unanimous decision at the Forum in Montreal, Canada.\n\nOn March 31, 1950, Kronowitz lost a bout by knockout to Bobby Hughes in Toledo, Ohio, 1:50 into the third round. On May 29, 1950, Kronowitz faced Joey De John at the State Fair Coliseum in Syracuse, New York. He was knocked out 2:11 into the first round by his opponent. De John was one of the more skilled opponents Kronowitz met at the end of his career, but his performance likely pushed him to retire. The Hughes bout was the end of a six bout losing streak for Herbie, and though he had faced several quality opponents near the end of his career, he realized his time in the ring had come to an end.[3]\n\nLife after boxing, 1950\nShortly after his retirement, Kronowitz purchased two New York City taxi medallions in 1950 and worked as a taxi driver.[2]\n\nLater, he worked as a referee for the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) for twenty nine years from 1955 to 1984. He was greatly respected and used the easy grace he gained from his years as a boxer to move quickly around the ring and take in every aspect of the bouts he refereed. He was considered an impartial and capable official.[3][2]\n\nKeeping a presence in the boxing world, he became a member of the \"Ring 8\" board of directors and an active member of the Veteran's Boxing Association.[3][2]\n\nHe was featured in 2007 in a Jewish exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street in Manhattan.\n\nKronowitz died November 9, 2012, in Brooklyn at the age of eighty-nine.",

He has worked for Marvel Comics on such titles as The Amazing Spider-Man, Thunderbolts, New Warriors, Venom and Ultimate Spider-Man and for DC Comics on Justice League of America, Batman and Trinity.\n\nEarly life\nMark Bagley was born to a military family in Frankfurt, West Germany.[citation needed]\n\nCareer\nAfter his work in the military and at Ringling College of Art and Design, Bagley continued trying to break into the comic industry. While working a construction job, he suffered a severe injury to his leg while using a handsaw that required 132 stitches. He eventually ended up working for Lockheed Martin making technical drawings.[1]\n\nMarvel Comics\nIn 1983, Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter created the Marvel Try-out Book to draw new talent into the comic book industry. The contest involved a deconstructed comic book which contestants could complete and submit to Marvel. The winner would be awarded a professional assignment with Marvel. At the time, Bagley was 27 years old and living in Marietta, Georgia.[2] He had almost given up on trying to find a job in comics and was satisfied with his position at Lockheed Martin. Bagley was reluctant to enter the contest because of the cost of the Try-out Book itself. His friend, Cliff Biggers, gave him the book and persuaded Bagley to enter the contest.[3] Bagley won first place for penciling, finishing ahead of thousands of other hopefuls.[2] After winning the contest, he did not hear from Marvel for several months. After approaching Shooter at a comic convention, Bagley was assigned to a series of low-profile penciling jobs. His comics work during this period included Visionaries, a comic book based on a 1980s toy line, various titles in the New Universe line, backup stories in Captain America,[4] and the first series of Marvel Universe Cards.[5]\n\nIn 1989, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz created a team of teenage superheroes called the New Warriors.[6] The following year, Marvel launched a new series based on these heroes and assigned Bagley and writer Fabian Nicieza to the title.[7] Bagley stayed on the title until #25, at which point he left to transition directly onto The Amazing Spider-Man.[3]\n\nWhen Erik Larsen left The Amazing Spider-Man in 1991, Bagley was assigned to the title. He and David Michelinie introduced the Carnage character in The Amazing Spider-Man #361 (April 1992)[8] and produced the Venom: Lethal Protector limited series in 1993. Although not the first artist to draw either Venom or Eddie Brock, Bagley's version of both characters are widely considered to be the most popular versions of them by fans.[9] Bagley was one of the artists on the \"Maximum Carnage\"[10] and \"Clone Saga\"[11] storylines which ran through the Spider-Man titles. Bagley's artwork was used extensively for licensed material, appearing on everything from plates and cups to credit cards and even video games such The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes released exclusively in Japan. In 2012, Comic Book Resources ranked Bagley fourth on its list of the \"50 Greatest Spider-Man Creators\".[12]\n\nIn 1997, Bagley collaborated with writer Kurt Busiek on a new team of superheroes, the Thunderbolts, a group of super-villains disguised as super-heroes, with the final page of the first issue of the series revealing that the Thunderbolts were actually the Masters of Evil, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel.[13]\n\nIn 2000, Marvel's then-publisher Bill Jemas was looking to relaunch Marvel's primary franchises in a way that would make them accessible to newer readers. Ultimate Spider-Man would be a title that began the Spider-Man mythos from the beginning set in modern times. Bagley was assigned to Ultimate Spider-Man with writer Brian Michael Bendis.[14] The Bendis/Bagley partnership of 111 consecutive issues made their partnership one of the longest in American comic book history, and the longest run by a Marvel creative team, beating out Stan Lee and Jack Kirby on Fantastic Four.[15] Bagley collaborated with Bendis on The Pulse and a four-issue arc on Mighty Avengers.[4]\n\nBagley's long and successful run on Ultimate Spider-Man earned him recognition in Wizard magazine's top ten artists of the 2000s in Wizard #219. Ranked #2 on the list, article writer Mark Allen Haverty noted of Bagley, \"no other artist came close to the number of comics Bagley sold [in the 2000s], nor the number of Top 20 comics he was a part of.\"[16]\n\nDC Comics\nIn 2008, Bagley signed an exclusive three-year contract with DC Comics.[17] His first assignment as a DC exclusive, the Trinity weekly series written by Kurt Busiek featured Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.[18][19]\n\nBagley drew four issues of Batman, written by Judd Winick. This was in the post-Battle for the Cowl world, with Dick Grayson having taken over as the Dark Knight.[20] Bagley then teamed with writer James Robinson on Justice League of America.[21] Bagley drew most of issues #38\u201353.[22]\n\nReturn to Marvel\nIn 2011, Bagley left DC and returned to Marvel and Ultimate Spider-Man. He reunited with writer Brian Michael Bendis and drew the \"Death of Spider-Man\" arc in issues #156\u2013160.[23] As he started the Ultimate imprint alongside Bendis, he was also called for Cataclysm, Ultimate End (which ended the imprint) and the last pages of Spider-Men II (which set up its return). Bagley and Bendis teamed for a creator-owned series, Brilliant, which was published through Marvel's Icon Comics Imprint. It has similarities to Mark Millar's own Icon comic, Kick-Ass, as it explores the idea of superheroes existing in the real world, however unlike Kick-Ass, the characters have actual super-powers.[24][25]\n\nBrian Michael Bendis and Bagley worked on Avengers Assemble, an Avengers title produced concurrently with Brilliant. To differentiate between other Avengers titles, Assemble consisted of the roster present in the Avengers film, but set in present Marvel continuity.[26]\n\nAs part of the Marvel NOW! initiative, Bagley and writer Matt Fraction relaunched the Fantastic Four series in 2012.[27][28] Bagley and Mark Waid collaborated on a Hulk series in 2014.[29]\n\nIn late 2017, Bagley made a return to Venom with issue #155, \"Lethal Protector\", written by Mike Costa. This brief return lasted only four issues.",

He did not meet his real father, now a painter in northern Italy, until he was 14. The father he knew remarried and divorced his mother, who became a social worker, several times over the next years. His mother died at the age of 58.\n\nFor much of Boberg's life he has enjoyed traveling. As a high school exchange student in 1977-1978, he lived in Aberdeen, South Dakota, an experience he describes in his book Americas. He also worked on a Wisconsin farm when he as 21 years old.\n\nAfter finishing high school in Denmark, he traveled to Southern Europe, North Africa (Egypt and Sudan) and India. In 1986 he moved to Barcelona for four years, where he met his wife Patricia, a filmmaker. Their son, Mateo, was born in Copenhagen in 1990. But the family soon moved on to Lima, Peru, where they lived for twelve years and where they still have an apartment.\n\nBoberg started writing poetry when he was 19, publishing his first book, Hv\u00e6sende p\u00e5 mit \u00f8jekast (The Hissing of My Glance), in 1984. Since then, he has published ten new books of poetry; his selected poems, Digte p\u00e5 vejen\u2014et udvalg (Poems on the Road\u2014A Selection) appeared in 2004. Boberg also writes prose works, which he views as the \"other side of the coin,\" so to speak. Besides Americas, he has written travel journals and diaries such as S\u00f8lvtr\u00e5den (The Silverthread) and a travel diary following the journeys of Ernesto Che Guevara, and, most recently, Invitation til at rejse (An Invitation to Travel).\n\nAs well as embedding his poems in the several locations of his travels, Boberg has an eye for the surreal and ultra-real in his poetry. He is particularly fond of classic writers such as Fernando Pessoa, C\u00e9sar Vallejo, Franz Kakfa, and modern Scandinavian authors such as Gunnar Ekel\u00f6f [see PIP, volume 1], Edith S\u00f6dergran [PIP, volume 2], Karen Blixen, and Hans Christian Andersen. In 2000, Boberg was nominated for the Nordic Literary Prize.\n\nQuoting from Boberg's poetry, critic Carsten Jensen has written: \"'Nothing is possible here where I am / but nothing is impossible either.'

He originated the role of Luke in 1978 and received a record eight Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series[2][3] prior to his retirement.[4] Geary had a prominent supporting role in the \"Weird Al\" Yankovic comedy UHF (1989); other notable films include Johnny Got His Gun (1971), Disorderlies (1987), Scorchers (1991), Teacher's Pet (2004) and Fish Tank (2009).\n\nEarly life\nAnthony Geary was born May 29, 1947, in Coalville, Utah, a son of a contractor father and homemaker mother.[5]\n\nCareer\nGeary made his first appearance on television in an episode of Room 222 and later appeared in All in the Family, The Mod Squad, Mannix, Marcus Welby, M.D., The Streets of San Francisco, and Barnaby Jones. Geary's first daytime role was in NBC soap opera Bright Promise from 1971 to 1972.[6]\n\nHe played George Curtis, who was a rapist, in The Young and the Restless from August to November 1973 and in 1978 was hired for a 13-week story arc to play Luke Spencer in ABC soap General Hospital. Luke Spencer began as a hit man and later became a rapist who fell in love with and subsequently married his victim, Laura Webber (played by Genie Francis). His portrayal of Luke Spencer on General Hospital was well received and grew into a full contract role. The 1981 on-screen wedding of his character and Laura Webber holds the record as the highest-rated soap opera episode of all time.[7]\n\nHe holds the distinction of winning a record eight Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He was first nominated in 1980 and had his first win in 1982.[8][9] Geary was nominated again in 1983, before leaving the show in 1984. Over the next several years he took roles in various theater and television productions, as well as in several films, but not at the level of success he had hoped for. Despite the popularity of his work as Luke Spencer, filmmakers such as Oliver Stone pigeonholed Geary based solely on the fact that he was a \"soap actor\". In a conscious effort to distance himself from General Hospital, he actively sought a role in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's film debut UHF (1989), that of the quietly eccentric scientist Philo (named for television pioneer Philo Farnsworth). Geary, a fan of Yankovic, went so far as to grow his hair out like Albert Einstein's and stay in character as Philo when meeting the film's casting team; he immediately landed the role.[10]\n\nIn 1991, Geary returned to General Hospital as Luke's cousin and look-alike Bill Eckert, due to the actor's desire to play someone other than Luke.[7] However, due to poor feedback from the viewing public, the character was killed off and Geary resumed the role of Luke in 1993.[7] Tony appeared in more than 50 stage plays, including an award-winning one-man show titled Human Scratchings in 1996. He was nominated in 1997 and 1998 for Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor, and had his second win in 1999,[8] and his third in 2000. He received another nomination in 2003, and had his fourth win in 2004.[11] When Geary won for the fifth time in 2006,[9][11] he set the record for the most lead actor wins.[7] Geary received another Emmy nomination in 2007, and in 2008, he again set a record for most lead actor wins with his sixth[12] Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor.[13]\n\nGeary set a record in 2012 with his seventh Daytime Emmy win and again in 2015 for his eighth win for Outstanding Leading Actor in a Drama Series after 16 nominations for the same role of General Hospital's Luke Spencer. Geary publicly announced on Friday, May 8, 2015, that he would be leaving his role on General Hospital.[citation needed] Geary finished taping his last scenes on the General Hospital set on June 23, 2015.[citation needed] His last air date was July 27, 2015.[citation needed] He later made a cameo appearance on a May 2017 episode to facilitate the retirement of co-star and former on-screen wife Tracy (played by Jane Elliot).[14][15]\n\nAn exception to his series of dramatic roles is the part of a scientist/studio engineer in the comedy movie UHF. He also appeared in 1987's Disorderlies, with rappers the Fat Boys.",

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers, San Diego Padres and Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nEarly life\nPrior to playing professionally, he attended Columbia High School in Lake City, Florida.[1] He was drafted by the Rangers in the fifth round of the 2005 amateur draft and began his professional career that year.\n\nProfessional career\nTexas Rangers\nWith the AZL Rangers in 2005, Kirkman went 3\u20131 with a 3.44 ERA in 14 games (nine starts), striking out 58 batters in 521\u20443 innings. He split 2006 between the AZL Rangers (eight games) and Clinton LumberKings (six games), going a combined 1\u20135 with a 9.70 ERA in 14 games (10 starts). He walked 51 batters in 341\u20443 innings while striking out 30. Despite posting an ERA near ten, he did not allow a single home run in 2006.\n\nKirkman pitched for the LumberKings (five games) and Spokane Indians (nine games) in 2007, going a combined 1\u20135 with a 7.14 ERA in 14 games (eight starts). He pitched for Spokane and Clinton again in 2008, improving to a combined record of 5\u20134 with an ERA of 3.84 in 17 games (16 starts).\n\n2009 became a breakout year for Kirkman. In eight Bakersfield Blaze games Kirkman threw 48 innings with a 2.06 ERA, striking out 54 and issued 18 walks. Kirkman was promoted to AA Frisco, threw 96 innings in 18 games and earned a spot on the 40_man roster after the 2009 season. In an interview with Jason Cole, Kirkman attributed his 2009 improvement to watching film of Cliff Lee.[2]\nI started watching Cliff Lee pitch, and I started watching video of him and video of me. I was comparing myself to him. One thing he did is he shortened up his front arm and it let him get through the ball rather than having to go around himself to get to the plate. That really, I think, is what turned me on.\n\n\u2014\u200aMichael Kirkman\nHe began 2010 with the Oklahoma City RedHawks and was ranked as the 15th best prospect at the start of the year by Jamey Newberg.[3][4] In his major league debut with the Rangers on August 21, he struck out the first three batters he faced and retired all four.\n\nAfter beginning the 2011 season with the Rangers, Kirkman was optioned to Triple-A on April 20.[5]\n\nOn May 21, 2012, the Rangers announced that Kirkman was being treated for skin cancer.[6]\n\nKirkman started the 2013 season with the Rangers until June 9 when he was placed on the 15-day disabled list, due to a reoccurrence of the skin cancer.[7] He was designated for assignment on March 28, 2014 and outrighted to the minors four days later.[8] He was called back up by the Rangers on September 2, 2014.[9]\n\nHe was non-tendered on December 2, 2014 and became a free agent.[10] He was later resigned, then released on March 17, 2015.[11][12]\n\nMilwaukee Brewers\nOn April 22, 2015, Kirkman signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.[13] He was released on August 1.[14]\n\nSan Diego Padres\nAfter signing a minor league deal with San Diego in February 2016, Kirkman was called up to the majors on April 26.[15] He was designated for assignment on May 2.[16]\n\nReturn to Milwaukee\nOn May 5, 2016, Kirkman was claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers.[17] He was designated for assignment on May 13, 2016, to make room for waiver claim Jhan Marinez.[18][19]\n\nAtlanta Braves\nThe Atlanta Braves signed Kirkman to a minor league contract on January 31, 2017.[20] He was released on March 29, 2017.",

The Rochester Knighthawks won their third NLL Championship, and first-ever in Rochester, defeating the Edmonton Rush 9-6 in the final game.[2]\n\nMid-way through the off-season, the Boston Blazers announced that they would not be participating in the 2012 season due to problems in securing a facility in which to play.[3] A dispersal draft was held and Dan Dawson, for the third time in his career, was the first overall pick, heading to the Philadelphia Wings.[4] Kyle Rubisch was taken second by the Edmonton Rush, and the Minnesota Swarm chose Anthony Cosmo and Josh Sanderson with the third and fourth picks. The Swarm immediately traded Sanderson to the Toronto Rock. Casey Powell, after a knee injury in the MLL Championship game, wasn't chosen until the second round when the Rochester Knighthawks took a chance. Powell did not play in 2012 at all.\n\nBoth defending division champions got off to rough starts in 2012, as the Toronto Rock lost their first two and the Washington Stealth lost their first three. The Rock recovered and won their next three, eventually finishing atop the East division, but the Stealth had their worst season in franchise history, finishing 4-12 and the only team out of the playoffs. The Buffalo Bandits won their first two games but then went on a franchise-record six-game losing streak, during which head coach and GM Darris Kilgour called the team \"stupid\" and \"pathetic\", and said \"I totally question the hearts of basically everybody but about four guys on our team\".[5] The Bandits won three of their last four games to finish in fourth place in the East and getting a first-round playoff game against the Toronto Rock.\n\nThe Colorado Mammoth only won 5 games in 2011 but in 2012, they had surpassed that total before losing a game. The Mammoth began the year winning 6 in a row and finished with an 11-5 record, good for second in the west behind the 12-5 Calgary Roughnecks. Despite having a league-high 12 rookies playing on the roster,[6] the Minnesota Swarm surprised many finishing third with a 9-7 record.\n\nThe 2012 season will be known as a record-breaking year in the NLL. John Grant, Jr. was named league MVP for the second time in his career after scoring 116 points, breaking John Tavares' eleven-year-old single-season scoring record. Grant also scored his 500th career goal and 1000th career point during the season. Toronto Rock forward Garrett Billings finished only two points back of Grant but amassed 82 assists, breaking the old record of 74.\n\n",

He won the 2009 World Series with the Yankees, beating the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nProfessional career\nArizona Diamondbacks\nBruney was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 12th round (369th overall) after graduating from Warrenton High School (Oregon) in 2000.[1] Bruney pitched in the minors from 2000 to 2003, Bruney was called up to the Diamondbacks on May 8, 2004,[2] and made his major league debut that day against the Philadelphia Phillies, tossing a scoreless ninth inning in Arizona's 8\u20137 loss.[3]\n\nBruney in his rookie year with the Diamondbacks posted a 4.31 ERA and struck out 34 batters in 31.1 innings.[4] In 2005, the Diamondbacks tried Bruney as their closer, and he saved 12 games in 16 opportunities.[4] Overall, the 2005 season turned out to be a poor showing for Bruney. In 47 relief appearances, he posted a 7.43 ERA in 46 innings.[4] In May 2006, Bruney was designated for assignment by the Diamondbacks.[5]\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nBruney with the Yankees in 2007.\nBruney was later signed as a minor league free agent by the New York Yankees. Bruney pitched for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers until being recalled by the Yankees.[6] Armed with an upper-90s fastball, mid-80s curveball and an aggressive approach, Bruney quickly established himself as one of the better relief pitchers in the Yankees' bullpen. Bruney finished 2006 with a 1\u20131 record and a 0.87 ERA in 19 games (20.2 innings).[4]\n\nIn 2007, he spent time on both the Yankees' major league roster and their Triple-A team. He ended the season with a 4.68 ERA in 58 major league games.[4]\n\nBruney reported to spring training 2008 having lost 20 pounds in the offseason, in addition to gaining speed on his fastball.[7] On April 25, 2008, it was learned that Bruney would likely miss the remainder of the season due to a fracture in his foot (Lisfranc) but he chose to forgo foot surgery in order to rehab the injury.[8][9] After spending time rehabbing in the minors, he returned to the Yankees on August 1 following the trade of Kyle Farnsworth.[10] On January 30, 2009, Bruney signed a one-year deal worth $1.25 million to avoid arbitration with the Yankees. He was slated to be Mariano Rivera's primary setup man going into the 2009 season.[11]\n\nIn 2009, Bruney spent part of the season on the disabled list with a 3.92 ERA and 1.51 WHIP in 39 innings pitched.[4] On June 13, 2009, Bruney criticized New York Mets closer Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, calling his antics on the mound \"unbelievable\" and saying that Rodriguez has \"got a tired act.\" Rodr\u00edguez responded after the Mets won that day's game by saying \"somebody like that, it doesn't bother me,\" and suggesting that Bruney \"better keep his mouth shut and do his job, not worry about somebody else. I don't even know who the guy is. I'm not going to waste my time with that guy. Instead of sending messages through the paper, next time when you see me at Citi Field, come up to me and say it to my face.\"[12] During batting practice the following day at Yankee Stadium, Rodr\u00edguez confronted Bruney on the field, pointing and shouting at him before teammates from both sides could separate the two.[13]\n\nBruney did not appear in the ALDS against the Twins or the ALCS against the Angels, but was added to the World Series roster.[14] On October 28, it was announced that Bruney would be replacing backup catcher Francisco Cervelli on the 25-man roster for the World Series.[15]\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nBruney with the Washington Nationals during spring training in 2010\nOn December 7, 2009, Bruney was traded to the Washington Nationals for Jamie Hoffmann, Washington's pick in the 2009 Rule 5 draft.[16] On May 25, 2010, the Nationals released him after designating him for assignment on May 17.[17]\n\nMilwaukee Brewers and New York Mets\nBruney signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on June 1, 2010,[18] but was released on June 21 after pitching 3+1\u20443 scoreless innings with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds.[19] Bruney signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on July 2, 2010.[20] Bruney became a free agent after the 2010 season ended.[21]\n\nChicago White Sox\nIn December 2010, Bruney signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox.[22] He had his contract purchased on May 30, 2011.[23] He made his debut with the White Sox on May 31 against the Boston Red Sox, allowing two runs in 2/3 of an inning.[24] On August 5, the White Sox designated Bruney for assignment.[25] He was released on August 15.[26]\n\nOn November 29, 2011, Bruney re-signed a minor league contract with the White Sox.[27] He was called up from AAA Charlotte on June 22, 2012, after Philip Humber was placed on the DL.[28]\n\nPersonal life\nAs a child, Bruney was an extra in the movie Kindergarten Cop.[29]",

        "premise": "James Paul Conrad (born February 12, 1977) is an American retired soccer player who played as a defender. During his 13-year MLS career, he was four-time MLS Best XI and the 2005 MLS Defender of the Year. He also earned 27 caps with the United States men's national soccer team and went to the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAfter his playing career Conrad has worked in the media industry[2] and currently stars on his YouTube channel Jimmy Conrad, he also streams on Twitch regularly. He currently serves as the technical director of USL League Two side San Francisco Glens.\n\nEarly life\nOn February 12, 1977, Conrad was born in Arcadia, California. Conrad attended Temple City High School in Temple City, California.[3][4]\n\nConrad attended Temple City High School in Temple City, California and was a four-year letterman in soccer. Conrad played at San Diego State University in 1994 and 1995, and then transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles. While playing for UCLA, he was a member of the 1997 NCAA Championship team.\n\nPlaying career\nProfessional\nUndrafted by MLS, Conrad had an unsuccessful trial with the Los Angeles Galaxy. However, the Galaxy coaching staff recommended he play for one of their affiliated lower division teams. Consequently, Conrad contacted the now-defunct San Diego Flash of the A-League which gave him a contract. In 1999, Brian Quinn became the head coach of the San Jose Clash. When Quinn began searching for an additional defender and goalkeeper for the Clash, Ralf Wilhelms, head coach of the Flash and a former teammate of Quinn on the San Diego Sockers, recommended Conrad and Flash goalkeeper Joe Cannon.[5] The Clash signed Conrad that year. He played with the club, later re-branded as the Earthquakes, for four seasons, helping them to the MLS Cup in 2001. In 2000, he also played for Lech Pozna\u0144 in Poland.\n\nIn 2003, Conrad was traded to the Wizards for a second-round draft pick, which the 'Quakes used to select Arturo Alvarez. Conrad's stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he helped the Wizards to the US Open Cup and the MLS Cup Final as the leader of the league's stingiest defense and was named to the league's Best XI and was a finalist for MLS Defender of the Year Award. He won the award a year later.\n\nDespite rumors of a possible European transfer following the Wizards' disappointing 2006 season, Conrad renewed his contract with the Wizards beginning the 2007 season, and new head coach Curt Onalfo rewarded him the club captaincy.\n\nConrad was out of contract after the 2010 MLS season and elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 15, 2010, Conrad was selected by Chivas USA in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft.[6] He made his debut, and scored his first goal for his new team on March 19, 2011 in their first game of the 2011 MLS season \u2013 ironically against his old club, Sporting Kansas City.[7]\n\nAfter struggling with injury during the 2011 season, and suffering from side effects of six concussions, Jimmy Conrad announced his retirement from professional soccer on August 18, 2011.[8]\n\nInternational\nConrad received his first cap for the United States national team on July 7, 2005, in a Gold Cup match against Cuba. Less than one year later, Conrad made the U.S. roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In Germany, Conrad came in as a substitute against Italy in the team's 1\u20131 draw with the eventual champions, and played all ninety minutes against Ghana. On January 20, 2007, Conrad captained the national team for the second time, where the United States hosted an international friendly with Denmark. The U.S. won that match 3\u20131. On February 7, 2007, in an international friendly with Mexico, Conrad was named the Man of the Match. He scored his first-ever goal for the U.S. in the fifty-second minute of that match. On June 25, 2009, after not having played with the national team in previous qualifying, Conrad was named to the U.S. squad for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.[9]\n\nCoaching\nIn September 2018, Conrad became technical director and head associate coach of the San Francisco Glens.[10] He was named head coach of the Glens ahead of the 2020 season.[11] In 2022, Conrad returned to his role as technical director and head associate coach for the Glens to work with new head coach Gabe Saucedo. The club made the USL League Two playoffs for the first time that season, upsetting top-seeded Capital FC before bowing out in the Western Conference semifinals.",

        "premise": "Howard the Duck is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Steve Gerber and artist Val Mayerik. Howard the Duck first appeared in Adventure into Fear #19 (cover-dated Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered anthropomorphic animal trapped on a human-dominated Earth. Echoing this, the most common tagline of his comics reads 'Trapped In a World He Never Made!'.\n\nHoward's adventures are generally social satires, while a few are parodies of genre fiction with a metafictional awareness of the medium. The book is existentialist, and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: \"... that life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view.\"[1] Gloria Katz, producer of the notorious, ill-fated 1986 film adaptation of the comic, expressed a diametrically opposed opinion of the character, \"It's a film about a duck from outer space ... It's not supposed to be an existential experience.\"[2]\n\nHoward the Duck was portrayed by Ed Gale and voiced by Chip Zien in the critically and commercially unsuccessful 1986 self-titled film. Starting in 2014, the character, voiced by Seth Green, appeared in cameos in several Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, the Disney XD animated series Guardians of the Galaxy (2015\u201319) and Ultimate Spider-Man (2016; with Kevin Michael Richardson), and the Disney+ series What If...?

Born in August 1966 in Columbus, OH, Spybey received early career kudos when she snagged an Emmy for her early role as a young teen who has an illegal abortion in HBO's fact-based Public Law 106: The Becky Hill Story. Following up with small roles in such films as Big Night and SubUrbia (both 1996) and on the small screen in Men Behaving Badly and Remember WENN, the perky actress quickly began to gain career momentum. Equally comfortable on the silver screen or the small screen, Spybey continued with roles in Julian Po (1997) and Isn't She Great (2000). Married to actor Mark S. Waters in November 2000, the millennial turnover found Spybey's career in full swing with her Six Feet Under performance and roles in such high-profile releases as John Q. and Full Frontal (both 2002). A role in the raunchy television puppet show Greg the Bunny proved that even with her career catching fire, the good-humored actress retained her funnybone and didn't take herself too seriously.",

He played nine years in Major League Baseball, principally as a pitcher and outfielder, for five different major league clubs. He appeared in 379 major league games, 279 as a pitcher and 122 as an outfielder, and his longest stretches were with the Detroit Wolverines (288 games, 1881\u20131885, 1887) and the Kansas City Cowboys (51 games, 1886).\n\nAs a pitcher, Weidman compiled a 101\u2013156 (.393) win\u2013loss record with a 3.61 earned run average (ERA) in 2,318+1\u20443 innings pitched. He led the National League in 1881 with a 1.80 ERA and totaled 45 wins in the 1882 and 1883 seasons. He pitched more innings for the Wolverines (1,654) than any other pitcher in the club's history.\n\nEarly years\nWeidman was born in Rochester, New York, in 1861.[1] He attended Rochester University and was a pitcher on the baseball team there in 1880.[2] He also played for the Hop Bitters Club of Rochester, with Buck Ewing as his catcher.[2] Weidman was given his nickname due to his stocky stature, standing 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) and weighing 165 pounds (75 kg).[3]\n\nProfessional baseball career\nBuffalo\nWeidman made his major league debut with the Buffalo Bisons on August 26, 1880. In the final weeks of the 1880 season, Weidman started 13 games for the Bisons and appeared in another four games as a relief pitcher. He compiled a 0\u20139 record and 3.40 earned run average (ERA) in 113+2\u20443 innings pitched.[1]\n\nWashington and Albany\nWeidman began the 1881 season with the Washington Nationals, then joined the Albany, New York, club in July 1881.[2]\n\nDetroit Wolverines\n\nWeidman (seated on ground, center) with the 1887 Detroit Wolverines\nAfter the Albany team folded, Weidman joined the Detroit Wolverines and brought his catcher Sam Trott with him.[2][4] Weidman and Trott made their debut for Detroit on September 3, 1881, a 4\u20133 loss against Buffalo.[4] Weidman started 13 games for Detroit in the last month of the season, compiling an 8\u20135 record and 1.18 ERA in 115 innings pitched. He led the National League in ERA and had the lowest WHIP rating (walks + hits per inning pitched) at 1.043.[1]\n\nWeidman had another strong year in 1882, winning 25 games, pitching 411 innings and 43 complete games with a WHIP rating of 1.046 (4th best in the National League).[1] On August 17, 1882, he was the losing pitcher in one of the great pitching duels in baseball history. Monte Ward was the pitcher for the Providence Grays, and he and Weidman held the game scoreless through 17 innings. Weidman allowed only seven hits but lost the game in the 18th inning on a home run by Old Hoss Radbourn, who was playing in right field.[2]\n\nWhile he won 25 games in 1882, Weidman also ranked among the league leaders with 20 losses. He lost at least 20 games for five consecutive seasons from 1882 to 1886, ranking among the league leaders in losses for each of those seasons.[1]\n\nWeidman also appeared 88 games as an outfielder for the Wolverines during the 1883 and 1884 seasons. He scored 58 runs, had 50 RBIs, and compiled a .175 batting average during those seasons.[1] Applying the sabermetric Wins Above Replacement (WAR) model, Weidman earned negative ratings of \u22121.6 and \u22121.7 in 1883 and 1884.[1]\n\nIn 1887, Weidman returned to the Wolverines, where he went 13\u20137, helping them to the 1887 National League pennant.[1] Over the course of six seasons, Weidman pitched more innings for the Wolverines (1,654) than any other pitcher in the club's history.[5]\n\nKansas City\nAfter the 1885 season, Weidman was released by the Wolverines to league control and then obtained by the newly formed Kansas City Cowboys. He appeared in 51 games as a starting pitcher for the Cowboys, including 48 complete games, and also appeared in three games as an outfielder. He compiled a win\u2013loss record of 12\u201336 (.250) and a \u22121.4 WAR rating with a 4.52 ERA in 427+2\u20443 inning pitched. He led the National League in both losses (36) and earned runs allowed (549).[1] His 36 losses in 1886 is tied for ninth highest in major league history.[6] The Kansas City club compiled a 30\u201391 record and disbanded after the 1886 season.[7]\n\nNew York\nIn early August 1887, Weidman was sold by Detroit to the New York Metropolitans for a price estimated at between $800 and $1,000.[1] Weidman started 12 games for the Metropolitans in the last half of the 1887 season and compiled a 4\u20138 record with a 4.64 ERA.[1]\n\nAt the end of the 1887 season, the Metropolitans sold Weidman to the New York Giants. Weidman appeared in one game for the Giants in 1887 and two games in 1888. He compiled a 1\u20132 record and 2.77 ERA in his three games with the Giants. He played in his last major league game with the Giants on July 5, 1888, at age 27.[1]\n\nMinor leagues\nAlthough his major league career ended in 1888, Weidman continued to pitch in the minor leagues. He compiled a 10\u20134 record for the Toronto Canucks in 1884.[8] Weidman remained in Canada in 1885, playing for the Hamilton Hams of the International League. He concluded his professional baseball career in 1893 with the Providence Clamdiggers of the Eastern League.[8]\n\nLater years\nAfter retiring from baseball, Weidman worked as an umpire for a time, including one season as an umpire in the National League. He then became a saloon operator in Rochester, New York. His first venture in the saloon business was the firm of Coughlin & Weidman. He later formed a partnership with his brother-in-law, Silk O'Loughlin, a well-known umpire. Weidman and O'Loughlin operated a saloon for several years at 158 State Street in Rochester. That establishment was sold in approximately 1903, after which Weidman and O'Loughlin conducted business at another location.[2][9]\n\nBy early 1905, Weidman developed a tumor which was believed to be throat cancer. He traveled to New York City where he met with medical specialists and underwent an operation that resulted in his death. He died in a New York hospital in March 1905 at age 44.[9] He was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Rochester, New York.[1] In an obituary, the Sporting Life wrote: \"Weidman was a clean-cut, honest and well behaved ball player, and a credit to his profession at all times.

He scored 58 runs, had 50 RBIs, and compiled a .175 batting average during those seasons.[1] Applying the sabermetric Wins Above Replacement (WAR) model, Weidman earned negative ratings of \u22121.6 and \u22121.7 in 1883 and 1884.[1]\n\nIn 1887, Weidman returned to the Wolverines, where he went 13\u20137, helping them to the 1887 National League pennant.[1] Over the course of six seasons, Weidman pitched more innings for the Wolverines (1,654) than any other pitcher in the club's history.[5]\n\nKansas City\nAfter the 1885 season, Weidman was released by the Wolverines to league control and then obtained by the newly formed Kansas City Cowboys. He appeared in 51 games as a starting pitcher for the Cowboys, including 48 complete games, and also appeared in three games as an outfielder. He compiled a win\u2013loss record of 12\u201336 (.250) and a \u22121.4 WAR rating with a 4.52 ERA in 427+2\u20443 inning pitched. He led the National League in both losses (36) and earned runs allowed (549).[1] His 36 losses in 1886 is tied for ninth highest in major league history.[6] The Kansas City club compiled a 30\u201391 record and disbanded after the 1886 season.[7]\n\nNew York\nIn early August 1887, Weidman was sold by Detroit to the New York Metropolitans for a price estimated at between $800 and $1,000.[1] Weidman started 12 games for the Metropolitans in the last half of the 1887 season and compiled a 4\u20138 record with a 4.64 ERA.[1]\n\nAt the end of the 1887 season, the Metropolitans sold Weidman to the New York Giants. Weidman appeared in one game for the Giants in 1887 and two games in 1888. He compiled a 1\u20132 record and 2.77 ERA in his three games with the Giants. He played in his last major league game with the Giants on July 5, 1888, at age 27.[1]\n\nMinor leagues\nAlthough his major league career ended in 1888, Weidman continued to pitch in the minor leagues. He compiled a 10\u20134 record for the Toronto Canucks in 1884.[8] Weidman remained in Canada in 1885, playing for the Hamilton Hams of the International League. He concluded his professional baseball career in 1893 with the Providence Clamdiggers of the Eastern League.[8]\n\nLater years\nAfter retiring from baseball, Weidman worked as an umpire for a time, including one season as an umpire in the National League. He then became a saloon operator in Rochester, New York. His first venture in the saloon business was the firm of Coughlin & Weidman. He later formed a partnership with his brother-in-law, Silk O'Loughlin, a well-known umpire. Weidman and O'Loughlin operated a saloon for several years at 158 State Street in Rochester. That establishment was sold in approximately 1903, after which Weidman and O'Loughlin conducted business at another location.[2][9]\n\nBy early 1905, Weidman developed a tumor which was believed to be throat cancer. He traveled to New York City where he met with medical specialists and underwent an operation that resulted in his death. He died in a New York hospital in March 1905 at age 44.[9] He was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Rochester, New York.[1] In an obituary, the Sporting Life wrote: \"Weidman was a clean-cut, honest and well behaved ball player, and a credit to his profession at all times. Peace to his ashes.\"[2]\n\n",

His career encompassed soul, country, and pop. His most successful songs are 1977's \"I Go Crazy\", a No. 7 pop hit which once held the record for the longest chart run on the Billboard Hot 100, and 1982's \"'65 Love Affair\", which at No. 6 is his highest-charting single. Another pop hit, \"Cool Night\", was released in 1981. In the mid-1980s, he also had two No. 1 country hits as a guest vocalist on songs by Marie Osmond and Tanya Tucker.\n\nCareer\nDavis was born in Meridian, Mississippi, United States.[3] He was a member of a local group called the Six Soul Survivors around 1966 and later in another group called the Endless Chain. In 1968, he was a writer for Malaco Records, based in Jackson, Mississippi. Ilene Berns, widow of Bert Berns, signed Davis to Bang Records in 1969, and in 1970, released a cover version of The Jarmels' hit \"A Little Bit of Soap\", reaching No. 52 on the Billboard Hot 100.[3] His first album, A Little Bit of Paul Davis, was released in 1970. In 1974, he recorded his third album, Ride 'Em Cowboy, and the title track, his first top 40 single, peaked at No. 23 on January 18, 1975.[3] (The same song became a Top 40 Country hit for Juice Newton in 1984.) Davis also reached No. 35 in September 1976 with \"Superstar\", a tribute song not related to any of the 1971 hits by that name.[3]\n\nDavis had his first American Top 10 single with the ballad \"I Go Crazy\", which after 30 weeks on the Hot 100 peaked at No. 7 on March 18, 1978.[3] \"I Go Crazy\" spent 40 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100,[3] which at the time set the record for most weeks on the chart. The follow-up, \"Sweet Life\", also did well, peaking at No. 17. On May 17, 1980, his gospel-tinged \"Do Right\" peaked at No. 23, and Casey Kasem noted the religious aspects of this song, along with other songs before it, on that day's edition of American Top 40.

The single contained a third verse of music which was not included on the album version, and despite its Top 40 and AC success, had never been reissued on any CD release until Wounded Bird reissued the Best of Paul Davis compilation in 2011. Davis retired from making records for a time, except for two duets that went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. The first was in 1986 with Marie Osmond singing \"You're Still New to Me\";[3] while the second, in 1988, was a collaboration with Tanya Tucker and Paul Overstreet singing \"I Won't Take Less Than Your Love\". Davis also wrote \"Meet Me in Montana\", which his friend Dan Seals and Osmond took to No. 1 on the Billboard country chart in 1985, and \"Bop\", a solo No. 1 country hit for Seals in early 1986.\n\nPersonal life and death\nDavis was an avid golfer,[5] and was also an avid billiards enthusiast.

Shortly after, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly because of heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records, and recorded the album 'Round About Midnight in 1955.[2] It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish music-influenced Sketches of Spain (1960), and band recordings, such as Milestones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959).[3] The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,[4] having sold over five million copies in the U.S.\n\nDavis made several line-up changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts, and Seven Steps to Heaven (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and drummer Tony Williams.[3] After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964,[3] Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P (1965) and Miles Smiles (1967),[5] before transitioning into his electric period.

From August 1881 to August 1883 the expedition, consisting of 25 officers and men, recorded 500 observations each day on weather and tides and collected and studied samples of minerals, flora, and fauna. Discoveries made on sledge trips included Lake Hazen and Greely Fjord on the western side of Ellesmere. When a relief ship failed to arrive in early August 1883 the party abandoned Fort Conger and moved southward in small boats. Covering 500 miles (805 kilometres) in 51 days, the men landed at Bedford Pym Island in Smith Sound on October 15.

At the end of the war he received a brevet promotion to major in recognition of his wartime accomplishments.\n\nAfter the war, Greely accepted a second lieutenant's commission in the regular army. In 1881, he was appointed to command the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition, a 25-man expedition organized to carry out Arctic explorations. The expedition ran short of food and several resupply and rescue missions were unsuccessful, and by the time Greely and his men were rescued in 1884, there were only six survivors.\n\nIn March 1887, Greely was serving as a captain when President Grover Cleveland appointed him as the Army's Chief Signal Officer with the rank of brigadier general. As Signal chief, he was responsible for creating and maintaining the worldwide communications networks required during and after the Spanish\u2013American War and during the Philippine\u2013American War.

He signed to Bigger Picture Music Group and has released two albums: Craig Campbell (2011) and Never Regret (2013). He has had eight singles on the country chart.\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nCraig Campbell was born in Lyons, Georgia.[1] He grew up as one of five children in a blended family. His parents divorced when he was young, leaving his oldest sister\u201411 years his elder\u2014to take care of the siblings while his mom worked many jobs. His mother married his stepfather when Craig was 7. He saw his biological father every other weekend until his dad died when he was 11.[2] He played piano at his mother's church from age 10 to 18, and formed a band called Out of the Blue as a teenager.[1] He also won contests sponsored by True Value Hardware at 15 and at 18.[3]\n\n2010\u20132014: Craig Campbell and Never Regret\nIn 2002, Craig Campbell moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he found several musician jobs. He also recorded demos and began writing songs after fellow singer Luke Bryan persuaded him.[1] Campbell also gained a gig playing in Tracy Byrd's road band.[4]\n\nCampbell signed to Bigger Picture Music Group and released his debut single, \"Family Man\", on July 26, 2010.[5] It was included on an extended play titled Five Spot[6] and on his self-titled debut album, which was released on April 5, 2011. \"Family Man\" reached the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart with a peak of number 14 in April 2011. The album's second single, \"Fish\", released to country radio in June 2011, and reached number 23 in October 2011. \"When I Get It\" peaked at 38 in early 2012.\n\nCampbell released his fourth single, \"Outta My Head\", in late 2012. The song was included on a second extended play of the same name and also appears on his second studio album, Never Regret, released on May 7, 2013. The album's second single, \"Keep Them Kisses Comin'\", was released to country radio on December 2, 2013, and would become his biggest hit. In May 2014, it was announced that Bigger Picture would be closing. Campbell was the label's most commercially successful artist.[7] Despite the label's closure, Campbell called radio stations and asked them to continue playing the song, resulting in it staying on the charts six weeks after the label's closure in addition to reaching the top 10.[8]\n\n2014\u2013present: See You Try EP\nOn December 1, 2014, Campbell announced he had signed with Red Bow Records.[9] His first single for the label, \"Tomorrow Tonight\", was released to country radio on May 19, 2015, and it reached a peak of number 39 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart. It was followed by \"Outskirts of Heaven\", which was released on April 11, 2016. It reached a peak of number 24 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart in early 2017, but no album was released. On April 9, 2018, Campbell released \"See You Try,\" his third single under Red Bow. Both \"Outskirts of Heaven\" and \"See You Try\" were featured on his seven-song EP, See You Try, which was released on June 8, 2018. Campbell parted ways with Wheelhouse in February 2019.",

        "premise": "Email this page\nMother Teresa\nAcceptance Speech\nMother Teresa held her Acceptance Speech on 10 December 1979, in the Aula of the University of Oslo, Norway.\n\nTranscript of Mother Teresa\u2019s Acceptance Speech, held on 10 December 1979 in the Aula of the University of Oslo, Norway.\nLet us all together thank God for this beautiful occasion where we can all together proclaim the joy of spreading peace, the joy of loving one another and the joy acknowledging that the poorest of the poor are our brothers and sisters.\n\nAs we have gathered here to thank God for this gift of peace, I have given you all the prayer for peace that St Francis of Assisi prayed many years ago, and I wonder he must have felt the need what we feel today to pray for. I think you have all got that paper? We\u2019ll say it together.\n\nLord, make me a channel of your peace, that where there is hatred, I may bring love; that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness; that where there is discord, I may bring harmony; that where there is error, I may bring truth; that where there is doubt, I may bring faith; that where there is despair, I may bring hope; that where there are shadows, I may bring light; that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.\n\nLord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted; to understand, than to be understood; to love, than to be loved. For it is by forgetting self, that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. It is by dying, that one awakens to eternal life. Amen.\n\nGod loved the world so much that he gave his son and he gave him to a virgin, the blessed virgin Mary, and she, the moment he came in her life, went in haste to give him to others. And what did she do then? She did the work of the handmaid, just so. Just spread that joy of loving to service. And Jesus Christ loved you and loved me and he gave his life for us, and as if that was not enough for him, he kept on saying: Love as I have loved you, as I love you now, and how do we have to love, to love in the giving. For he gave his life for us. And he keeps on giving, and he keeps on giving right here everywhere in our own lives and in the lives of others.\n\nIt was not enough for him to die for us, he wanted that we loved one another, that we see him in each other, that\u2019s why he said: Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.\n\nAnd to make sure that we understand what he means, he said that at the hour of death we are going to be judged on what we have been to the poor, to the hungry, naked, the homeless, and he makes himself that hungry one, that naked one, that homeless one, not only hungry for bread, but hungry for love, not only naked for a piece of cloth, but naked of that human dignity, not only homeless for a room to live, but homeless for that being forgotten, been unloved, uncared, being nobody to nobody, having forgotten what is human love, what is human touch, what is to be loved by somebody, and he says: Whatever you did to the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.\n\nIt is so beautiful for us  to become holy to this love, for holiness is not a luxury of the few, it is a simple duty for each one of us, and through this love we can become holy. To this love for one another and today when I have received this reward, I personally am most unworthy, and I having avowed poverty to be able to understand the poor, I choose the poverty of our people. But I am grateful and I am very happy to receive it in the name of the hungry, of the naked, of the homeless, of the crippled, of the blind, of the leprous, of all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared, thrown away of the society, people who have become a burden to the society, and are ashamed by everybody.\n\nIn their name I accept the award. And I am sure this award is going to bring an understanding love between the rich and the poor. And this is what Jesus has insisted so much, that is why Jesus came to earth, to proclaim the good news to the poor.  And through this award and through all of us gathered here together, we are wanting to proclaim the good news to the poor that God loves them, that we love them, that they are somebody to us, that they too have been created by the same loving hand of God, to love and to be loved. Our poor people are great people, are very lovable people, they don\u2019t need our pity and sympathy, they need our understanding love. They need our respect; they need that we treat them with dignity. And I think this is the greatest poverty that we experience, that we have in front of them who may be dying for a piece of bread, but they die to such dignity. I never forget when I brought a man from the street. He was covered with maggots; his face was the only place that was clean. And yet that man, when we brought him to our home for the dying, he said just one sentence: I have lived like an animal in the street, but I am going to die like an angel, love and care, and he died beautifully. He went home to God, for dead is nothing but going home to God. And he having enjoyed that love, that being wanted, that being loved, that being somebody to somebody at the last moment, brought that joy in his life.\n\nAnd I feel one thing I want to share with you all, the greatest destroyer of peace today is the cry of the innocent unborn child. For if a mother can murder her own child in her own womb, what is left for you and for me to kill each other? Even in the scripture it is written: Even if mother could forget her child \u2013 I will not forget you \u2013 I have carved you in the palm of my hand. Even if mother could forget, but today millions of unborn children are being killed. And we say nothing. In the newspapers you read numbers of this one and that one being killed, this being destroyed, but nobody speaks of the millions of little ones who have been conceived to the same life as you and I, to the life of God, and we say nothing, we allow it. To me the nations who have legalized abortion, they are the poorest nations. They are afraid of the little one, they are afraid of the unborn child, and the child must die because they don\u2019t want to feed one more child, to educate one more child, the child must die.\n\nAnd here I ask you, in the name of these little ones, for it was that unborn child that recognized the presence of Jesus when Mary came to visit Elizabeth, her cousin. As we read in the gospel, the moment Mary came into the house, the little one in the womb of his mother, leapt with joy, recognized the Prince of Peace. And so today, let us here make a strong resolution, we are going to save every little child, every unborn child, give them a chance to be born. And what we  are doing, we are fighting abortion by adoption, and the good God has blessed the work so beautifully that we have saved thousands of children, and thousands of children have found a home where they are loved, they are wanted, they are cared. We have brought so much joy in the homes that there was not a child, and so today, I ask His Majesties here before you all who come from different countries, let us all pray that we have the courage to stand by the unborn child, and give the child an opportunity to love and to be loved, and I think with God\u2019s grace we will be able to bring peace in the world. We have an opportunity here in Norway, you are with God\u2019s blessing, you are well to do. But I am sure in the families and many of our homes, maybe we are not hungry for a piece of bread, but maybe there is somebody there in the family who is unwanted, unloved, uncared, forgotten, there isn\u2019t love. Love begins at home. And love to be true has to hurt. I never forget a little child who taught me a very beautiful lesson. They heard in Calcutta, the children, that Mother Teresa had no sugar for her children, and this little one, Hindu boy four years old, he went home and he told his parents: I will not eat sugar for three days, I will give my sugar to Mother Teresa. How much a little child can give. After three days they brought into our house, and there was this little one who could scarcely pronounce my name, he loved with great love, he loved until it hurt. And this is what I bring before you, to love one another until it hurts, but don\u2019t forget that there are many children, many children, many men and women who haven\u2019t got what you have. And remember to love them until it hurts. Sometime ago, this to you will sound very strange, but I brought a girl child from the street, and I could see in the face of the child that the child was hungry. God knows how many days that she had not eaten. So I give her a piece of bread. And then the little one started eating the bread crumb by crumb. And I said to the child, eat the bread, eat the bread. And she looked at me and said: I am afraid to eat the bread because I\u2019m afraid when it is finished I will be hungry again. This is a reality, and yet there is a greatness of the poor. One evening a gentleman came to our house and said, there is a Hindu family and the eight children have not eaten for a long time. Do something for them. And I took rice and I went immediately, and there was this mother, those little ones\u2019 faces, shining eyes from sheer hunger. She took the rice from my hand, she divided into two and she went out. When she came back, I asked her, where did you go? What did you do? And one answer she gave me: They are hungry also. She knew that the next door neighbor, a Muslim family, was hungry.\n\nWhat surprised me most, not that she gave the rice, but what surprised me most, that in her suffering, in her hunger, she knew that somebody else was hungry, and she had the courage to share, share the love. And this is what I mean, I want you to love the poor, and never turn your back to the poor, for in turning your back to the poor, you are turning it to Christ. For he had made himself the hungry one, the naked one, the homeless one, so that you and I have an opportunity to love him, because where is God? How can we love God? It is not enough to say to my God I love you, but my God, I love you here. I can enjoy this, but I give up. I could eat that sugar, but I give that sugar. If I stay here the whole day and the whole night, you would be surprised of the beautiful things that people do, to share the joy of giving. And so, my prayer for you is that truth will bring prayer in our homes, and the fruit of prayer will be that we believe that in the poor, it is Christ. And if we really believe, we will begin to love. And if we love, naturally, we will try to do something. First in our own home, our next door neighbor, in the country we live, in the whole world. And let us all join in that one prayer, God give us courage to protect the unborn child, for the child is the greatest gift of God to a family, to a nation and to the whole world. God bless you!\n\nDid you find any typos in this text? We would appreciate your assistance in identifying any errors and to let us know.

A former investment consultant and partner in the Bach Group, Bach left that business in 2001 to found his own company, FinishRich Media and to organize its FinishRich seminars. His first popular advice book, Smart Women Finish Rich: Seven Steps to Achieving Financial Security and Funding Your Dreams, set the pattern for other books to come: the 2001 Smart Couples Finish Rich: Nine Steps to Creating a Rich Future for You and Your Partner; the 2004 title The Automatic Millionaire: A Powerful One-Step Plan to Live and Finish Rich; Start Late, Finish Rich: A No-Fail Plan for Achieving Financial Freedom at Any Age and The Automatic Millionaire Homeowner: A Powerful Plan to Finish Rich in Real Estate, both published in 2005; his 2008 work promoting green financing, Go Green, Live Rich: Fifty Simple Ways to Save the Earth andGet Rich Trying; and others. In addition to writing books, Bach is a popular motivational speaker, who makes frequent appearances on television.\n\nBach does not present miracles in his book, but rather some very old-fashioned advice, such as to start saving now for the long term. Another obvious piece of advice that too often goes unappreciated is that in order to save more, a person needs to spend less. He approaches this problem via what he terms the \"latte factor.\" If a person were to drink a latte per day from Starbuck's or some other coffeehouse, after a year that person would be about 1,000 dollars poorer. However, if the same person took that money and invested it long-term, after about thirty years it could turn into 100,000 dollars. Bach's point is that everyone must have some luxury they indulge in that could be cut back, thereby freeing up more money for saving and investment. He also advises readers to cut down on credit-card debt. A reviewer for the Simple Dollar noted that \"if you've read one David Bach book, you've covered most of the material in all of his books.\"\n\nIn each of his books, however, Bach targets a niche audience, with advice directly tailored to those specific needs. In Smart Women Finish Rich, he acknowledges that women are better at setting up and sticking with savings plans and takes this information into account when designing a multiple-step program to achieve financial security. In Smart Couples Finish Rich, he advises couples to set common goals in order to make achieving financial security more of a team effort. \"By focusing on how a couple can work on common goals together, the book [brings] to light the idea that money can be something that further unites people rather than pulls them apart,\" remarked Sarah Colwell in a North Carolina Lawyers Weekly review of Smart Couples Finish Rich. Writing in Research, Mary Scott observed that it was easy to see why the book was reaching bestseller lists: \"It's dearly written, direct and provides excellent advice to people on what is often a difficult subject.\"\n\nIn The Automatic Millionaire, Bach proposes that people pay themselves first as the most important ingredient in attaining wealth. That is, one should set aside between ten and fifteen percent of gross income for savings before even thinking of such things as taxes or other investing. In order to keep up with this savings plan, Bach recommends that people set up automatic payments to a retirement account. Despite pointing out the fact that such a savings regimen might not be possible for millions ensnared in credit-card debt, a Publishers Weekly reviewer concluded that Bach's \"easygoing approach, complete with real-life examples and clever phrases \u2026 will appeal to the many money-challenged consumers [resolving] to get their finances on a firmer footing.\" Writing in Booklist, David Siegfried observed, \"Bach shows how to eliminate a few unnecessary daily expenditures \u2026 and use the savings to secure your future.\" Bach gets more specific with his The Automatic Millionaire Homeowner, in which he advises investment in real estate. One tip is to buy and live in a new home every five years to continually increase one's equity. A Publishers Weekly contributor remarked on the author's \"ability to enthusiastically lead readers through even the most arcane aspects of home buying.\" Booklist writer Mary Whaley concluded that Bach \"offers a thoughtful approach to investment opportunities in home buying and important insight into financial management.\"\n\nBach even offers hope to those who have too long procrastinated in planning for their financial future. Start Late, Finish Rich lets the reader know it is never too late to start saving. Again Bach's advice is simple but important: one needs to save more, spend less, and make more. Observed a Publishers Weekly reviewer, \"[Start Late, Finish Rich] reads like an infomercial script, brassily positive and unrelentingly motivational.\"\n\nWith Go Green, Live Rich, Bach indulges one of his private passions, environmentalism. According to a Publishers Weekly contributor, Bach \"offers a multitude of suggestions for conserving the planet\u2014and your money.\" In this work, Bach urges that people make environmental awareness a part of their daily lives, from recycling to using compact fluorescent light bulbs and investing in green businesses. A Publishers Weekly critic termed Go Green, Live Rich a \"winning and wise guide.\" USA Today reviewer Kerry Hannon commented that \"Bach makes a convincing pitch that \u2018going green\u2019 is not a luxury, an expensive choice, you can't afford.\" Hannon went on to note that Bach's \"tips are not outlandish or unreasonable.\" As with his other financial advice books, Bach demonstrates how, with common-sense steps, one can gain financial security; however, with Go Green, Live Rich, he ties such prosperity to cleaner, greener living.\n\n",

At RISD, Caldecott Medalist David Macaulay, one of Floca\u2019s teachers, connected him with Avi, the children\u2019s-book author who needed an illustrator for the book he was working on \u2014 a new kind of \u201ccomic-book novel.\u201d\n\nThe result of Floca\u2019s work with Avi, who goes by the one name, was \u201cCity of Light, City of Dark,\u201d published in 1993 as one of the first serious graphic novels for children. Since then, Floca has illustrated more than two-dozen books for Avi and other writers. He\u2019s also written and illustrated a half-dozen books of his own, including \u201cThe Racecar Alphabet\u201d and \u201cDinosaurs at the Ends of the Earth.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Floca\u2019s book, \u201cLightship,\u201dwon a Sibert Honor as one of the best informational books for children that year. (The Robert F. Sibert Medal is awarded annually by the American Library Association to the best nonfiction kids\u2019 books; several honor books also are usually chosen).\n\nMost Read Entertainment Stories\nReview: In Tacoma, Morgan Wallen affirms reign as country's hottest, most polarizing star\nReview: The Postal Service, Death Cab for Cutie turn back the clock in Seattle  VIEW\n'Boys in the Boat' author Daniel James Brown's favorite Redmond places\nRant & Rave: Smoker put a damper on reader's Japanese Garden visit\nHow Seattle's Jazz Alley, now 43, became a premier destination\nThis year, Floca won another Sibert Honor for his book, \u201cMoonshot: The Flight of Apollo 11\u201d (Atheneum, $17.99), which also was chosen by The New York Times as one of the best children\u2019s books of 2009.\n\nFloca still marvels at the trajectory his career has taken. At a recent talk with the Children\u2019s Book Guild of Washington, D.C., Floca noted that \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that what I was doing was creating \u2018informational books for children\u2019 \u201d until 2008, when he won his first Sibert Honor.\n\nFloca\u2019s nonfiction books use the picture-book format, but their blend of information and illustrations actually works best for kids ages 7-10. In creating his own books, Floca says that he focuses on subjects in which he\u2019s always been interested \u2014 subjects like race cars, dinosaurs, trucks and, especially, astronauts.\n\nFloca actually created his first book about an Apollo mission nearly a decade ago. The book was never published, however, as Floca found that his initial effort to write about the subject was overloaded with information. So he put it aside, and worked on other projects.\n\nA few years ago, Floca decided to try again.\n\n\u201cIt ended up being an interesting way to do a nonfiction book \u2014 read as much as you can, wait five years, and the things you remember will be the key parts of your book.\u201d\n\nSkip Ad\nWhile creating \u201cMoonshot\u201d was a labor of love, it wasn\u2019t easy. There were multiple drafts of both the text and the illustrations, and Floca went through dozens of designs for the cover. (Those interested in finding out more about the book\u2019s backstory can check out Floca\u2019s notes on his Web site, http://brianfloca.com/MoonshotNotes.html).\n\nIn \u201cMoonshot,\u201d Floca perfectly captures the awesome nature of the Apollo 11 flight, both to the astronauts who were on it, and those who were watching them far below. In fact, Floca is particularly proud of his decision to include illustrations of a family following the mission.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re never really mentioned in the text, but they help humanize the story,\u201d he said.\n\nBorn in Temple, Texas, Floca says he\u2019s been drawing \u201cfor as long as I can remember.\u201d His debut as a published illustrator may have come in the fourth grade. That\u2019s when his teacher, Mrs. Persons, included his drawings of scenes from \u201cStar Wars\u201d on the class\u2019s mimeographed lesson plans, even though, as Floca says, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the Death Star had nothing to do with what we were studying that week.\u201d\n\nAt Brown, Floca studied art, history and art history, and cartooned for the school newspaper. Floca later earned a master\u2019s from the School of Visual Arts.\n\nToday, Floca calls himself \u201ca picture-book guy,\u201d saying that he loves \u201cvisual storytelling.\u201d He\u2019s just finished illustrating \u201cA Ballet for Martha: Making Appalachian Spring,\u201d a book written by Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan. His own next children\u2019s-book project will focus on steam locomotives.\n\nSkip Ad\n\u201cI like the idea that I\u2019m making books that kids will read \u2026,\u201d Floca said. \u201c\u2026 But mostly what I like about making children\u2019s books and picture books in particular is that they give me the chance to find something that interests me \u2026 to really try to figure it out, and then try to find a pleasing way to put together a story about it in words and images,\u201d Floca said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like making a movie. A very small movie, but I get to be screenwriter, director and director of photography, and I enjoy all those roles.\u201d\n\nKaren MacPherson, the children\u2019s/teen librarian at the Takoma Park, Md., Library, can be reached at Kam.Macpherson@gmail.com.",

        "premise": "Bookstores are more than just repositories of knowledge. They\u2019re living, breathing, evolving representations of our best selves.\n\u2014 Celeste Ng\nIllustration by Brian Floca.\nIllustration by Brian Floca.\n\nI hope you\u2019re reading. A lot. \n\nRight now is as important a time to tackle the stack of hardcovers, power up the Kindle or renew the library membership as ever there was in our entire lifetime. \n\nRight now we need to read to stay informed, to get woke and to stay sane. If you want to feel better, turn off the news, put down the newspaper and pick up a book. Then talk about what you read with your friends and the good feelings keep on spreading.\n\nWords written with extreme care and deep consideration over deliberate periods of time are what\u2019s needed right now. Whether you need to dig into required reading on race,  wish to learn more about pandemics, or you\u2019re ready to give your brain a break with some easy summer reads, you just need to know it wasn\u2019t typed into a tiny screen at 3am from the seat of the john. We\u2019ve endured enough knee jerks, hot takes and sound bites for a hundred lifetimes. And let\u2019s face it, on tough pandemic evenings, after long pandemic days, we can\u2019t crawl into bed with a good television, no matter how much we like to snuggle up to Netflix on the laptop. (Good) books are where it\u2019s at. \n\nIf you are someone who likes to buy books rather than swap with friends or take them out at the library, listen carefully. I have an important call to action. This is an easy change you can make to wield the power of your wallet and help small businesses stay alive during the shutdown: Do not buy books from Amazon. \n\nStarting today, adventure out of the Amazon search bar into the magical world of independent bookstore websites and IndieBound and independent publishers, all of whom you can buy from directly. Your days of soulless searching and unwanted, ill-considered, algorithmically-generated recommendations are over. Not only are you in for a lot of fun, but you are going to make a difference in a lot of people\u2019s lives.\n\nNone of us want to be part of making Jeff Bezos any richer.\nWhile the United Nations and the World Bank estimate that the pandemic will push an additional half a billion people (about 8% of the world\u2019s population) into poverty, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and the richest man in the world, becomes even richer every day. According to the World Bank, due to COVID-19, poverty rates will go up for the first time since 1998, as the global economy falls into recession and there is a drop in GDP per capita. Meanwhile, Bezos, who is worth over $178 billion, continues on track to become the world\u2019s first trillionaire. In one day alone during the pandemic, his net worth increased by $13 billion. \n\nA child collects bottles in a landfill in Nicaragua. According to the United Nations, hundreds of millions will be forced back into poverty due to the pandemic. Photo Hermes Rivera.\nA child collects bottles in a landfill in Nicaragua. According to the United Nations, hundreds of millions will be forced back into poverty due to the pandemic. Photo Hermes Rivera.\n\nAvoiding making Bezos richer is a good reason not to buy books from Amazon, but it\u2019s hard to deny that Amazon is convenient for procuring other necessities with zero exposure to strangers; things like Better Than Sex mascara and toilet paper and that specific brand of gummy vitamins that your friend\u2019s doctor recommended. Bezos is getting richer for a reason of course, so let\u2019s agree for the purposes of this article that when it comes to Amazon, we\u2019ll start by committing to not buying books. It would be rather epic f we could all agree to never use Amazon again, but that would decrease our success rate at this point. For now let\u2019s focus on BOOKS.\n\nIndependent bookstores play a critical role in local communities. They are centers of cultural exchange, intellectual discovery and emotional support. They welcome people in and invite civic discourse. They allow readers of all walks of life to hear directly from authors, publishers and thinkers and share their responses through forums and bookclubs. They employ local citizens. They keep local dollars in the community. \n\nBookstores, like communities, take pride in their unique identities. Entering a local bookstore can often feel like entering another world with its own oxygen and culture and rules. When I lived in Los Angeles in the early \u201890s I fell hard for Book Soup. Spreading out on the Sunset Strip between Palm Ave and Larabee Street, a stone\u2019s throw from Whiskey A Go Go and The Viper Room, Book Soup seemed almost too cool to be a bookstore. People-watching through the towering stacks of titles (owner Glenn Goldman was famous for over-ordering) put me in the mood to read for hours. If all those fascinating people could find inspiration on the shelves at Book Soup then I knew I was in the right place, too. That\u2019s where I bought American Psycho and Love Medicine and by first Cormac McCarthy. I also bought art and photography and filmmaking books. Walking into Book Soup was like diving under water in a reef, you never knew exactly what you\u2019d find but you knew it would be magical and exciting and entirely immersive.\n\nBook Soup always seemed most alive in the evening hours.\nBook Soup always seemed most alive in the evening hours.\n\nWhen you patronize local bookstores, you not only boost the local economy, you also support local culture, as bookstores provide a place where people can safely search for what they need, and connect with others who share their interests. Additionally, you support the local economy and job creation. Bookstores are not just dusty rows of books. The hearts of bookstores beat in the people who own them, run them and frequent them.\n\n \nChanging minds one book at a time - the mission of Frugal Bookstore\nTake Frugal Bookstore in Nubian Square in Roxbury, MA. The only black owned bookstore in Boston, Frugal has been a community hub since Leonard and Clarissa Egerton bought it from Bob Romanow in 2008.  Frugal\u2019s stated mission, \u201cto change minds one book at a time\u201d confirms their commitment to promoting literacy and encouraging learning for readers of all ages. Author events, student literacy programs and even community jam sessions make Frugal Bookstore more than just a place to buy books. During the racial justice uprising in the months since George Floyd\u2019s death, Frugal has been a source of solidarity, information and comfort.\n\nIndependent bookstores are my first steps in any new city \u2014 a quick check of the pulse in any literary community. They are ports in the storm, passageways to magical lands, escape hatches out of bad moods. Even when I don\u2019t think I need a book, because the stack beside my bed is teetering towards the ceiling, I always need a bookstore. And then I usually need a book, too.\n\u2014 Emma Straub\nBrookline Booksmith has maintained a full schedule of author events, held virtually. Photo, Boston Globe.\nBrookline Booksmith has maintained a full schedule of author events, held virtually. Photo, Boston Globe.\n\nIn the U.S., retail is a massive force in the economy, to the tune of $2.6 trillion. So when we purchase from local retailers rather than massive online retailers, we wield a powerful tool for social change. \n\nIndependent bookstores often generate less than a million dollars a year\u2013making them very small businesses. \u201cFor every $100 you spend in a locally owned bookstore, $73 stays in the local economy, whereas unsurprisingly $100 spent online to an out-of-state retailer returns zero dollars to our communities,\u201d according to Roxanne Coady, owner of R. J. Julia, an independent bookstore in Madison, CT. \n\nCourtney Flynn, of Trident Booksellers in Boston regrets the way Amazon has devalued books to another category of cheap things they sell in order to collect people\u2019s data. \u201cAmazon was positioned to benefit from the pandemic, and they certainly have. We have always been a brick and mortar store, and that's what we had to offer over Amazon. The rise of Amazon is directly responsible for the failure of many small businesses, but the ones that have survived until now have found ways to offer something that Amazon cannot, which is an in-person experience. Unfortunately, we aren't able to do that anymore, so we've had to compete online. The erosion of small business that Amazon has done over the years is devastating, and that will most likely get worse. [But] If you like walking into a space that is open and inviting, that offers expertise advice, that really cares about what they're selling, then you should want to support your local bookstore.\u201d \n\nsergiu-valena-XnjKlX_BFKs-unsplash.jpg\nrenee-fisher-wpMtTNPg6vk-unsplash.jpg\nrumman-amin-IFBu75dwGJs-unsplash.jpg\nnorbert-toth-I1oL89qxefc-unsplash.jpg\nThanks to incredibly robust web offerings, you don\u2019t have to be anywhere near a bookstore geographically to take advantage of its unique offerings. Consider the #readingisresistance series from the Unabridged Bookstore in Chicago, including titles such as Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Hood Feminism by Mikki Kendall; the Collection List from the Frugal Bookstore in Roxbury, MA including titles like Our time is Now by Stacey Abrahms and The Room Where it Happened by John Bolton; or the First Editions Clubs and Book Clubs open to everyone through author Ann Patchett\u2019s Nashville based bookstore Parnassus Books. \n\nAt A Room of One\u2019s Own in Madison, WI, patrons get their reading in no matter what they\u2019re up to.\nAt A Room of One\u2019s Own in Madison, WI, patrons get their reading in no matter what they\u2019re up to.\n\nMany indie bookstores also do a lot for marginalized groups in their areas. Trans-owned A Room of One\u2019s Own bookstore which has been a staple in Madison, Wisconsin since 1975, supports not just one, but three prison literacy programs: LGBTQ books to prisoners, Wisconsin books to prisoners, and the Jail library group through the Wisconsin Involvement Network.",

        "premise": "Tips for prospective coaches from Mount Union's Larry Kehres\nStaff WriterAkron Beacon Journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some highlights of what former Mount Union football coach Larry Kehres told Jim Tressel\u2019s and Jim Dennison\u2019s \u201cPrinciples of Coaching\u201d class at the University of Akron on Wednesday night. Kehres, 64, retired after last season but remains the school\u2019s athletic director. He won 11 Division III national championships and 23 Ohio Athletic Conference titles during his 27 years as Mount Union's coach.\n\nKehres said he majored in economics at Mount Union because he found it interesting, but wasn\u2019t enamored with the job prospects when he was interviewing in 1971. He got a phone call from a man who had been his professor, wondering if he was interested in a graduate assistant position for coach Don Nehlen at Bowling Green. \"I was going to meet coach Nehlen at 8 a.m. on Saturday. I rode up on Friday evening. I used to arrive for a 6:40 p.m. class at 5:05, so I arrived well before 8 o\u2019clock. I wore my one good sportcoat, a Harris tweed. I was waiting outside his office. A couple minutes after 8 he came out. He reached out his hand and said, \u2018Hey, Larry, that is a nice sportcoat.\u2019 My advice to you is to wear your best duds.\u201d\n\nAfter a year at Bowling Green, Kehres said he still wasn\u2019t convinced he wanted to be a football coach. But he took a job coaching at Johnstown Monroe High School in Johnstown, Ohio, in 1973 because his wife was teaching near there. In 1974, Kehres returned to Mount Union and spent 11 seasons as an assistant before taking over as coach before the 1986 season.\n\nOn his retirement, Kehres said, \u201cThe hardest thing is ending a job on your terms. I miss sitting in video sessions with players, miss the planning for success. Really what I miss the most is planning for practice and trying to implement the plan and trying to do the same on game day. The real deal is the interaction with athletes. That\u2019s what you have to love and be passionate about or a lifetime career in coaching might be hard.\u201d\n\nKehres said it is critical for coaches to learn how to handle family situations. He recalled how a player\u2019s sister picked Oct. 7 for her wedding. \u201cI said, \u2018Go to that wedding, it\u2019s a once in a lifetime event. We have 10 football games.' When there were commitments due to faith or education that conflicted with practice or games, we had to come in second. Players at Mount arrive late and leave early for classes. Cecil Shorts, a successful receiver for the Jacksonville Jaguars, had a class he had to have for his major. Practice started at 3:45 and he didn\u2019t arrive until 4:25. That\u2019s 40 minutes of critical individual instruction time, but that\u2019s the way it works.\u201d\n\nKehres talked about athletes\u2019 behavior and skills. Big on his list is eye contact. \u201cI taught classes for years at Mount Union. I wanted students to make eye contact when I was teaching. The computer snuck in late in my career. Eye contact is critical if I\u2019m going to communicate with a student effectively. There can be a lack of interest or bad attitude if there\u2019s no eye contact.\u201d\n\nWhen he was looking for players, Kehres said he wanted them tough, skilled and smart.\n\nHe said for each position he identified five key skills he wanted a player to exhibit and listed them in an order of importance. Kehres said everyone on the staff needed to know the five skills for each position because that was what the coaches would try to develop at practice and would set up their individual and group drills accordingly.\n\nFor quarterbacks, those were accuracy as a passer, good agility, good decision-making skills, arm strength and leadership. \u201cIf I was at a Division I school arm strength would probably be higher than fourth. If I was coaching DI athletes I might put speed above agility. I used to say, \u2018I\u2019ve never had a knucklehead at quarterback and you\u2019re not going to be the first.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want any dorm incidents or any of that. Leaders don\u2019t get themselves in social trouble.\u201d\n\nWhen he talked of accuracy, Kehres held his arms straight out to his sides and bent them up at the elbows to illustrate the box where the ball needs to be thrown. \u201cThat notion if you get your hands on it you should catch it, that\u2019s an old adage.\u201d\n\nMount Union went on winning streaks of 54 and 55 games during his tenure and Kehres remembered a crucial game in one of those 14 years ago that was covered by Lesley Visser of CBS Sports and a reporter from USA Today. \u201cLesley Visser came, wow, was she pretty. I didn\u2019t even tell my wife I talked to her. The writer from USA Today said to me on the field, \u2018Can I go in the locker room and hear your pre-game pep talk?\u2019 I said, \u201cYou can go in, but you won\u2019t hear much of a pre-game pep talk. I went from somebody trying to be Vince Lombardi to Donald Duck. There are great pep talks by coaches; I\u2019m not one of those guys. I\u2019m into systematic instruction performed properly in practice. I\u2019m not accepting that until we\u2019re doing this right. That gets men to handle the stress of the game. Nothing I could say in the last five minutes could replace that. He looked at me like, \u2018You\u2019re a Donald Duck,\u2019 but we won, we got the winning streak. It might be your strength; it wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d\n\nKehres remembered one year when the Purple Raiders returned to campus from the championship game and didn\u2019t know where the trophy was. \u201cWe forgot to take it home. It\u2019s not about those things. If you\u2019re going to spend your career in coaching, you have to enjoy and relish the idea that you\u2019re constantly planning.\"\n\nKehres said he was driven by a fear of failure. \"I was always more fearful than hopeful. \u2018How can I avoid this bad event from happening \u2013 an interception, a bad block, a loss?\u2019 I was driven to prevent those issues that get in way of success. Don\u2019t fix it after it got broke, don\u2019t let it get broke. I wasn\u2019t driven by money, I worked at Mount Union.\u201d\n\nKehres said when his teams lost in the championship in 2009, \u201910 and \u201911 he took over the play-calling duties for his final season in 2012. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave one thing undone. They\u2019d put tremendous pressure on themselves. They didn\u2019t want to be a group that left without accomplishing their goal.\u201d",

His mother, Gayle, was a harpist and an equestrian.[1]\n\nA fan of video games, Ledford began his career in 1990 by founding Gametronix. The business grew to become America's second largest importer of Japanese video games and consoles such as Mega Drive, Famicom, Super Famicom and PC Engine.[2] John's interest in anime began after being introduced to My Neighbor Totoro.[3] In 1992, he and his business partner Matt Greenfield turned their attention to the anime industry and founded A.D. Vision.[4]\n\nA.D. Vision (aka ADV Films or ADV) became a global leader of anime entertainment, innovation, media diversity, branded consumer products, licensing and publishing.[5] By its tenth year, ADV was the largest employer of actors in the Southwest United States and expanded to include Tokyo and UK branches. Within a decade, ADV cemented its status as a major distributor of anime in North America, releasing titles such as Neon Genesis Evangelion, Sailor Moon, and Hello Kitty.[6][7] The company also released live-action films on DVD, such as Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda (TV Series) and Earth Final Conflict as well as the Sci-Fi Channel and Jim Henson hit series Farscape, promoted original film releases and ventured into extreme wrestling with Combat Zone Wrestling.\n\nLedford then founded Anime Network, North America's first all-anime dedicated cable TV network, in 2001; it grew from just 500,000 households to reach over 40,000,000 households.[8] The following year he started publishing Newtype USA in partnership with Kadokawa Publishing.

He served as a member of the Florida Senate from 2008 to 2016, representing parts of Collier and Lee Counties in Southwest Florida. Prior to being elected to the Senate, Richter served one term in the Florida House of Representatives, representing a Naples-based district from 2006 to 2008.\n\nHistory\nRichter was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and served in the United States Army from 1969 to 1971, earning a Bronze Star Medal and a Combat Infantry Badge in the process. He then served in the United States Air Force Reserves from 1979 to 1981. Richter attended the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with his bachelor's degree in 1981, and then completed a graduate program at the Graduate School of Banking at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\n\nIn 1987, Richter moved to Florida, where he served on the Greater Naples Chamber of Commerce, the Collier County Education Foundation, the Economic Development Council of Collier County, and Leadership Florida. He was a founding director of the First National Bank of Naples until 1997, when it was acquired by the FNB Corporation. Richter was a founder of and executive at the First National Bank of Florida prior to its acquisition by Fifth Third Bank in 2005. Since 2007, he has worked as the President of the First Florida Integrity Bank.\n\nFlorida House of Representatives\nIncumbent State Representative J. Dudley Goodlette was unable to seek re-election in 2006 due to term limits. Richter ran to succeed him in the 76th District, which stretched from North Naples to Marco Island in western Collier County. Richter was unopposed in the Republican primary, and faced Ken McPherson, the Constitution Party nominee. He was endorsed by the Naples Daily News, which praised his focus on \"affordable housing and insurance as the big issues facing Florida and the Legislature,\" though they noted that \"[s]ome of his goals and positions on key issues could use a tuneup.\"[1] Ultimately, Richter defeated MacPherson handily, winning 78% of the vote to MacPherson's 22%.[2]\n\nFollowing Richter's election to the House, he initially started campaigning to be Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives for the 2012-2014 legislative term, but he withdrew as fellow State Representative Will Weatherford solidified support.[3]\n\nDuring the 2008 legislative session, Richter sponsored legislation with State Senator Michael S. Bennett that would have allowed business owners to purchase commercial property insurance without the threat of assessments from the state.[4]\n\nFlorida Senate\nIn 2008, incumbent State Senator Burt Saunders was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, instead opting to launch a congressional campaign against Congressman Connie Mack IV. Richter ran to succeed him in the 37th District, which included Cape Coral and Fort Myers in Collier and Lee Counties. He was unopposed in both the Republican primary and the general election, and won his first term entirely uncontested.[5]\n\nWhen the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Richter opted to run for re-election in the 23rd District, which contained much of the territory that he had previously represented. As was the case in 2008, Richter did not face an opponent in the primary or general elections and was re-elected without opposition. Upon being re-elected, Richter noted, \"I'm looking forward to continuing my service to the Legislature by advancing sound fiscal policy and continuing to support Governor Scott's agenda for economic growth and private sector job growth.\"[6]\n\nDuring the 2016 legislative session, Richter sponsored legislation that would create a regulatory mechanism for allowing hydraulic fracturing and that would pre-empt local county and municipality bans on fracking.[7]",

        "premise": "Mary-Russell Ferrell Colton (March 25, 1889 \u2013 July 26, 1971) was an American artist, author, educator, ethnographer, and curator. She is one of the principal founders of the Museum of Northern Arizona. She was a member of the Philadelphia Ten, exhibiting at the group's annual shows from 1926 to 1940. She was also a member of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, the American Watercolor Society, and the American Federation of Arts. She is known for her advocacy of the arts, Native American rights, and women's rights. For her advocacy of Native American arts, she received a certificate of appreciation from the United States Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board in 1935. In 1982, she was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame.[1]\n\nPersonal background\nMary-Russell Ferrell was born on March 25, 1889, in Louisville, Kentucky. She is the daughter of Joseph and Elise (n\u00e9e Houston) Ferrell. Her father was known as one of the first Anglo-Americans to explore the Tenaya Canyon in what is now Yosemite National Park. After he died in 1904, Elise Ferrell remarried businessman Theodore Presser.[2]\n\nIn 1904 at age 15, Mary-Russell Ferrell enrolled at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women,[3] graduating in 1909 with honors. After her graduation, she opened a studio in Philadelphia. Her projects included art restoration and commercial art projects. In addition to the commercial art her studio produced, Mary-Russell Ferrell showed as a member of the Philadelphia Ten's annual exhibit in Florida, the Midwest, the Eastern States of the US and Europe.[4]\n\nOn May 23, 1912, Mary-Russell Ferrell married Harold Sellers Colton, a zoology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. They had two sons, Ferrell, born in 1914, and Sabin born in 1917. Sabin died of valley fever in Tucson in 1924. Their marriage lasted until her death.[5]\n\nProfessional background\nIn April 1926, the Coltons moved to Flagstaff, Arizona. During this time, she painted in and around the Colorado Plateau. She also established the Museum of Northern Arizona. Through her writing, painting and work as an advocate of Native American peoples and Native American arts, she made contributions to progressive education, the Indian arts and crafts movement and archeology.[6]\n\nColton served as the curator of art for the Museum of Northern Arizona for 20 years. She also recorded the history of the Colorado Plateau through her paintings and her MNA exhibits. She wrote 21 articles and two books.[7] As an artist and the curator of art at the museum, Colton often worked with Native American artists to bring recognition and acceptance of their work into the international art community.[4]\n\nThroughout her career as an artist, Colton painted a variety of subjects including landscapes, figures, still life and genre scenes.[8] She is known for her sensitive portraits utilizing vibrant, unusual color values.[4] The Christian Science Monitor of September 2, 1920, printed a copy of her painting, Sunset on a Lava Field. The author wrote; \"In her Arizona canvases, Mrs. Colton gives full sway to her love of color. One is impressed by the sense of vast remoteness that she manages to capture for these western paintings that are bringing her increasing recognition.\"[7]",

It is situated by the N\u00e4rke Plain, near the lake Hj\u00e4lmaren, a few kilometers inland along the small river Svart\u00e5n, and has a population of approximately 126,000 in the city proper.[7] It is one of the largest inland hubs of the country, and a major logistic and commercial operating site.\n\n\u00d6rebro is home to \u00d6rebro University, a major university hospital, a medieval castle, the water park Gustavsvik as well as several large shopping malls and the Oset and Rynningeviken Nature Reserve adjacent to lake Hj\u00e4lmaren.\n\n\u00d6rebro is served by \u00d6rebro Airport 10 km (6 mi) southwest of the city, and by \u00d6rebro Central Station, serviced by the M\u00e4laren Line and Western Main Line.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \u00d6rebro refers to a bridge (bro) crossing the river Svart\u00e5n where the city is located. The prefix \u00d6re- is derived from \u00f6r 'gravel (bank)'.[8]\n\nHistory\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nSee also: History of N\u00e4rke\n\n\u00d6rebro c.\u20091700, in Suecia antiqua et hodierna, with the castle in the middle\n\u00d6rebro received its Royal Charter and city privileges not later than 1404.\n\nThe location became a natural seat of commerce in the Scandinavian Middle Ages and is mentioned in print in the 13th century. Old buildings from the early days include the foundations of the city church, a building which has undergone several modifications. The natural center of the city is otherwise \u00d6rebro Castle, situated on an islet in the Svart\u00e5n, and dividing the town into a northern and a southern part. This castle was constructed during the stewardship of Birger Jarl during the late 13th century and then modified and enlarged during the reign of King Gustav Vasa in the 1560s. The \u00d6rebro Synod was held here in 1529.\n\nNotable events in \u00d6rebro's history include the national diet meeting at \u00d6rebro in 1810, where Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte was elected crown prince of Sweden.[9][10]\n\nAlthough a trade town, \u00d6rebro remained small until the second half of the 19th century, when it grew rapidly as a center of the national shoe-manufacturing industry.\n\nClimate\n\nRecreation area at \u00d6rebro University Hospital\n\u00d6rebro, like the rest of the area close to M\u00e4lardalen, has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) that is made milder by the proximity to water and the Gulf Stream which makes it interchangeable with oceanic climates. Summer temperatures occasionally exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) albeit not yearly, and temperatures above 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) are rare in winter, although frost-free nights sometimes occur. July high temperatures range from 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) to 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) depending on weather patterns, with a 2002\u20132014 mean high of around 23.4 \u00b0C (74.1 \u00b0F). During cold winters, \u00d6rebro receives plenty of snowfall. \u00d6rebro is far more prone than coastal areas to really harsh frosts with temperatures approaching or below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) happening almost every winter according to SMHI statistics. The station's setting in a rural location might skew temperatures somewhat compared to the urban area which is also at a slightly lower elevation and nearer Hj\u00e4lmaren. Especially when considering overnight lows this could render a small urban heat island effect in the city centre.\n\nHowever, the climate is very variable from year to year. For example, December 2010 was record cold with a daily mean of \u22129 \u00b0C (16 \u00b0F), whilst December 2006 only a few years before had a mean of 4.3 \u00b0C (39.7 \u00b0F).[11][12] The warmest month on record is 21.8 \u00b0C (71.2 \u00b0F) in July 2018 and the coldest on record is \u221212.8 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) in January 1987.[13][14] \u00d6rebro is often without snow cover for large parts of the winter months when daytime temperatures hover just above freezing \u2013 an exceptional feature for an inland area north of the 59th latitude.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature was set on 7 August 1975 during an intense heatwave with 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F),[15] which is a very high temperature for such northerly latitudes. During the 21st century, the record heat is 33.9 \u00b0C (93.0 \u00b0F) set on 8 August 2018.[16] The lowest recorded temperature in recorded history was set in February 1966 with \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F).[17] Several monthly records were set in the 2010s according to official SMHI statistics, namely the record highs of March, May, July, October and December as well as the coldest December temperature and month on record, that was set in 2010.[18] Humidity is high for most parts of the year, but adequately lower during summer months. In spite of this summer is generally the time that gets the most precipitation[19] due to clashes between hot and cool continental air systems causing heavy thunderstorm rainfall. In 2015, a 13.1 \u00b0C (55.6 \u00b0F) reading was recorded around the winter solstice which was a very warm reading for an inland area in the low-sun season.[20]",

        "premise": "In the first part of this thesis I will take into consideration the development of the snaphane movement from the end of the Scandinavian (Kalmar) Union until the last snaphane trials at the beginning of the 18th century. However, the emphasis will be on the Scanian War when the King\u2019s Friskytter Corps was established, and more specifically on the time from the battle of Lund in December 1676 until approximately the execution of baron Krabbe in January 1678, a period that was crucial and which saw both the foundation of the official Friskytter Corps and the radicalisation of the Swedish measures against all friskytter and snaphaner. The snaphaner/friskytter were generally perceived of as profoundly anti-Swedish. If one asks what it meant to be anti-Swedish one must also ask what it meant to be Swedish, Danish or Scanian at the time. It is important to stress that I do not take for granted that the snaphaner/friskytter were anti-Swedish but only that they were accused of being so by the Swedes. I have intentionally paid particular attention to the 'dark and bloody dimensions' of the Scanian War: it is not the main theme of the thesis but a minor theme. To me it is obvious that all wars have dark and bloody dimensions and I cannot see why it should be wrong to analyse them as long as one is honest and clear about one\u2019s sources and theoretical framework. Whatever has been written on the snaphaner before has yes, described executions and torture, but not researched the gradual acceleration of violence on both sides, nor what led to it or how it was related to the development of the war in general. Nor has there been any sort of analysis of the 'demonisation of the snaphaner' on the Swedish side as compared to attempts to 'normalise the snaphaner' on the Danish side. I have tried to interpret the workings of the demonisation process and to make clear that it is a process that is characteristic of that kind of situations and also to refer to the religious importance it had to be able to classify the snaphaner as non members of the Christian community.",

From early single-camera silents to its current multi-screen mediations, the repeated treatment of football in British cinema points to the game\u2019s importance not only in the everyday rhythms of national life but also, and especially, its immutable place in the British imaginary landscape. Through close textual analysis together with production and reception histories, this book explores the ways in which professional footballers, amateur players and supporters (the devoted and the demonized) have been represented on the British screen. As well as addressing the joys and sorrows the game necessarily engenders, British football is shown to function as an accessible structure to explore wider issues such as class, race, gender and even the whole notion of \u2018Britishness\u2019. \nBack to top\nKeywords\nfootball\nBritish\nfilm\nsports\nplayer\nnational identity\nclass\nrace\ngender\nBack to top\nReviews\n \u201cStephen Glynn\u2019s survey will be welcomed by film historians and historians of sport \u2026 The British Football Film is a more than helpful compendium, and Glynn proves a sure-footed and undogmatic guide.\u201d (Dilwyn Porter, Journal of British Cinema and Television, Vol. 16 (2), April, 2019)\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the first full-length study of the British football film.

He won every honour with his beloved Barrs and was a dual player with Cork.\n\nOne person who could not speak highly enough of him was former Barrs great, club chairman and club secretary Tony Maher. He described Ryan as a club great with a legacy that will endure.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I want to say that the club has lost a truly marvellous former player and person. I had the honour of playing with him for a short while, he was beginning his career and I was coming to the end of mine.\n\n\u201cI suppose it all started in 1976 when the Barrs won the county minor hurling and football titles. He was on those teams and a lot of those players went on to become the cornerstone of very successful senior teams.\n\nBarrs won the county in 1985.

Front: Liam Cronin, Thomas Sheehan, Tony Sheehan, Ger Keane, Eddie Forde, Joe O'Reilly.\nFormer Cork All-Ireland winning player and manager Billy Morgan remembers Christy too and has great memories of their time together.\n\n\u201cHe was somebody I had a fierce time for as a player and person. He started out as a forward but went back to centre-back where he enjoyed great success. \n\n\u201cWe won the national league in 1980, defeating Kerry in the final and Christy was a great captain of that team. He was a fine dual player, very strong physically and he was great to deal with.\n\n\u201cThere was always a great rivalry between ourselves in Nemo and the Barrs but off the field, there was great respect and a great friendship too between the players and Christy was one of them.\"\n\nMorgan spoke too of his great courage in battling illness over the past few years.\n\n\u201cYes, he battled his illness with a huge amount of bravery and never gave in to it, he accepted the situation and got on with it. He\u2019s a huge loss to his family first and foremost and, of course, to the Barrs club and the GAA in general in Cork.\"\n\nOne player who played with and against Christy on the field was Tadhg Murphy from Sarsfields, the scorer of that dramatic, last-gasp goal in 1983 when Cork stunned Kerry. \n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s desperately sad. I would describe Christy as a gentle giant, a tower of strength on the field and a very generous person off it.\n\n\u201cHe was a great Cork captain when I played with him, a great motivator, a very popular person in the dressing room and a fine character. Yes, he was captain that day in '83 when I was fortunate enough to get the goal against Kerry.\n\nKerry's Jack O'Shea takes on Christy Ryan of Cork.

He played in 20 senior county finals for us, winning 11. He has six Munster Club medals, four All-Ireland club medals and so much more.\n\n\"He was a person of the highest integrity, so honest, a warrior really.

        "premise": "PLAYERS OF THE PAST\n \n\nSWANSEA CITY PAST PLAYERS (Post War)  A-Z\n\nA\n\nPAWEL ABBOTT\nThe Polish striker arrived at the Liberty from Huddersfield Town for \u00a3150,000 in January 2007. A Poland Under-23 international, he was brought in to fill the void left by Rory Fallon, who had left to join Plymouth. He made his debut as a substitute in a 2-0 win over Gillingham and scored his only goal for the Swans in a 2-1 victory at Rotherham in Roberto Martinez\u2019s first game in charge. Abbott featured in the side that narrowly missed out on a place in the play-offs at the end of the 2006-07 season, before departing during the summer for Darlington after 18 appearances (nine as sub) and one goal. He went on to sign for Darlington, Oldham, Charlton and Polish clubs Ruch Chorz\u00f3w and Zawisza Bydgoszcz.\n\nPETER ABBOTT\nStriker Peter Abbott was a member of Harry Gregg's squad at Swansea City. A former Manchester United apprentice, he turned professional in October 1970 but failed to secure a first-team slot and moved to the Vetch Field initially on loan in February 1974. He made his League debut in that month's 3-0 win at home to Stockport and netted three goals in 41 Fourth Division games for Swansea prior to joining Hartford Bi-Centennials in May 1976. Reuniting with Harry Gregg at Crewe Alexandra in August 1976, he joined Southend United in July 1977 and was a promotion winner in 1977-78, then returned to the United States.\n\nTAMMY ABRAHAM\n\nA tall, gangly striker, Abraham spent the 2017-18 season on loan with the Swans from parent club Chelsea. After a promising start to the campaign, Tammy and the team struggled, and he ended up with just five goals as the Swans were relegated from the Premier League. After leaving the Swans, the England international spent a season on loan at Aston Villa where he found his goalscoring form again to help the club secure promotion to the Premier League with a play-off victory over Derby County at Wembley. He has since gone on to make his mark in the Premier League with Chelsea, where he was an academy graduate; making two first-team appearances in 2016 before a successful loan move to Bristol City.\n\nREUBEN AGBOOLA\nVersatile left-back Reuben Agboola gained Nigerian international recognition whilst at Swansea City. Signing professional for Southampton in April 1980, he gained considerable top-flight experience before joining Sunderland for \u00a3150,000 in January 1985. He helped them win the Third Division title in 1987-88 and was loaned to Charlton Athletic and Port Vale before moving to the Vetch Field in November 1991. Making 28 League appearances for Swansea prior to joining Woking in August 1993, he then played for Gosport.\n\nPAUL AGNEW\nFormer Northern Ireland U-23 left-back Paul Agnew briefly played for Swansea City during the 1987-88 campaign. Initially with Cliftonville, he joined Grimsby Town for \u00a315,000 in February 1984 and starred in their 1989-90 and 1990-91 promotion successes. He followed Alan Buckley to West Brom for \u00a365,000 in February 1995 and reunited with Keith Alexander at Ilkeston Town in July 1997. Moving to Swansea on non-contract terms in September 1997, he made seven Third Division appearances before joining Wisbech Town in December 1997.\n\nADEBAYO AKINFENWA\nNigerian striker Adebayo Akinfenwa scored the winner in Swansea City's 2006 Football League Trophy final triumph. Initially with Watford, he then played for Atlantas and scored their winner in the 2001 Lithuanian Cup final. He joined Barry Town in August 2002 and featured in their 2003 Welsh Cup final success, then had spells with Boston United, Leyton Orient, Rushden & Diamonds and Doncaster Rovers before moving to Torquay United in July 2004. Top scorer in 2004-05, he reunited with Kenny Jackett at Swansea for an initial \u00a335,000 in July 2005 and appeared in the 2005-06 League One play-off final.\n\n \n\nSANDY ALLAN\nScottish striker Sandy Allan had a loan spell at Swansea City during the 1972-73 season. A former amateur with Barnsley and Doncaster Rovers, he was a prolific goalscorer for Rhyl prior to joining Cardiff City for \u00a312,500 in March 1967. He netted a hat-trick against Mjondalen in the 1969-70 ECWC and moved to Bristol Rovers for \u00a312,500 in March 1970. Harry Gregg signed him on loan in March 1973 and he scored once in seven League games for struggling Swansea. He joined Cape Town City in March 1974, then had a spell as Harrogate Railway's player-boss before returning to South Africa to set up a window company.\n\nIVOR ALLCHURCH\nWelsh international inside-forward Ivor Allchurch is widely regarded as Swansea's finest post-war player. Signing professional at the Vetch Field in May 1947, the 'Golden Boy' was leading marksman three times before moving to Newcastle United for \u00a328,000 plus Reg Davies in October 1958. He joined Cardiff City for \u00a315,000 in August 1962 and returned to Swansea for \u00a36,500 in July 1965. Scoring 164 goals in 445 League games overall for the Swans, he moved to Worcester City in July 1968, then was Haverfordwest's player-manager. Awarded the MBE, he later worked as a storeman and died in Swansea in May 1997.\n\nLEN ALLCHURCH\nWelsh international winger Len Allchurch was capped seven times whilst at Swansea. The younger brother of Ivor, he signed professional at the Vetch Field in October 1950 and featured in two consecutive Welsh Senior Cup finals before being sold to Sheffield United for \u00a314,000 in March 1961. He helped them clinch promotion that season and moved to Stockport County in September 1965, starring in their 1966-67 Fourth Division triumph. Re-joining Swansea in July 1969, he netted 60 goals in 347 League games overall before moving to Haverfordwest in July 1971.\n\nJOE ALLEN\nThe Narberth-born midfielder joined the Swansea City family as an 11-year-old, coming through the youth ranks before making his mark in the first team. Allen made his senior debut in the final game of the 2006-07 season \u2013 a 6-3 home defeat against Blackpool at the Liberty. The seasons that followed saw Joe consolidate his position in the first-team squad, with the midfielder going on to make his Under-21 and senior bows for Wales. As the Swans progressed, so did Allen. He helped the club win promotion to the Premier League following the Play-Off Final win over Reading at Wembley, before going on to play a big part in the Swans\u2019 debut season in the top-flight. His outstanding performances earned him the Wales Player of the Year award for 2012 and he went on to follow Brendan Rodgers to Liverpool in a \u00a315million deal in the summer after 128 appearances (35 as sub) and seven goals.\n\nJOE ALLON\nEx-England Youth Striker Joe Allon featured prominently in Swansea City's 1987-88 promotion campaign. Signing professional for Newcastle United in November 1984, he moved to Swansea in August 1987 and scored in seven consecutive matches. He netted 12 times in 34 League games overall prior to joining Hartlepool United for \u00a310,000 in November 1988 and was top scorer in their 1990-91 promotion success. Sold to Chelsea for \u00a3300,000 in August 1991, he joined Brentford for \u00a3275,000 in November 1992 and later played for Port Vale, Lincoln City and Hartlepool again.\n\n \n\nJULIAN ALSOP\nStriker Julian Alsop was an influential figure in Swansea City's 1999-2000 Third Division title triumph. Initially with Nuneaton Borough, he had spells with VS Rugby, RC Warwick, Tamworth and Halesowen Town prior to joining Bristol Rovers for \u00a315,000 in February 1997. He moved to Swansea for \u00a330,000 in March 1998 after a loan period and netted 16 goals in 90 League games before joining Cheltenham Town in July 2000. Top scorer in two consecutive seasons, including their 2001-02 promotion success, he joined Oxford United in June 2003 and has since played for Northampton, Tamworth, Newport County and Carmarthen.\n\nKEVIN AMANKWAAH\nA tall, rangy full-back, Amankwaah arrived at the Liberty in July 2006 from Yeovil. After suffering a horrific car crash in 2002 that saw him break his neck, the defender recovered well to continue his football career. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t really suit the style of then boss Kenny Jackett and he was eventually released by Roberto Martinez, going on to sign for Swindon Town after 29 appearances (six as sub).\n\n ",

        "premise": "England boss Sam Allardyce keen on recruiting foreign-born players\n\nESPN staff\nAug 30, 2016, 02:52 AM ET\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFacebook Messenger\nPinterest\nEmail\nSam Allardyce says he remains keen to consider any player eligible for England regardless of whether they only qualify through residency.\n\nAllardyce has already confirmed that he had explored the possibility of calling up Sevilla midfielder Steven N'Zonzi, who spent six years in England with Stoke City and Blackburn Rovers, only to discover he was ineligible after having represented his homeland, France, at under-21 level.\n\nFabio Capello had previously made an attempt to secure Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta's services, which foundered for the same reason, and Allardyce said the Football Association has a department actively exploring potential options for new recruits.\n\nThe new England boss told reporters: \"Do you pick the best squad to win the World Cup, and if one or two of those are like N'Zonzi, do you do it? Or don't you? And then you suffer the consequences of not winning it or not getting to the quarterfinal and failure, so if that player is top quality...\n\n\"Cricket do it, don't they? Rugby do it, athletics do it. It's not happening anyway so we can cover that again if it does.\n\n\"It's not my department to find those. We have a department to look at the whole situation at all areas for every international team.\"\n\nAs Allardyce has highlighted, the England cricket team has regularly used foreign-born players such as Eoin Morgan and the rugby union side has players including Manu Tuilagi.\n\nThe football team has included players born outside England but has so far focused on those who moved to the country in their youth, like Jamaicans John Barnes and Raheem Sterling, or have English parents, like Owen Hargreaves.\n\n\nSam Allardyce says he will 'leave no stone unturned' in seeking to improve England. Martin Rickett / PA Wire/Press Association Images\nOther nations have brought in naturalised players, including Spain's Marcos Senna and Diego Costa and Portugal's Deco and Pepe, while Italy have a long history of using \"oriundo.\"\n\nAllardyce said naturalising foreign players \"happens in all the other countries\" and pointed to \"the shortage of English players in the Premier League,\" adding: \"I think it is only 31 percent, and if those don't play on a regular basis, surely if you are going to win something and that player is of the calibre to force his way into that side then you give him a chance.\n\n\n\"It's a very delicate subject. I'll have to see if I actually do it one day how it's perceived across the nation. If he goes out and scores the winner, will it be quite that bad?\"\n\nEngland have endured a long period of disappointment at international level, and the criticism of the players' efforts at Euro 2016 has persisted due to the contrast with Great Britain's success at the Olympic Games, where only United States collected more gold medals.\n\nAllardyce said: \"I think that we all come under scrutiny in football terms, particularly after the Olympics, about what is our identity? The Olympians have got great credit for what they've done and achieved again, so what do we take from that to make our identity?\n\n\"For me it's about going out and the players showing not just how passionate they are, but how skilful they are at international level.\"\n\n\nThe 61-year-old former Bolton, Blackburn, West Ham and Sunderland boss said he was viewing the England job as \"the final challenge of a long career\" and that he would \"leave no stone unturned, to give them [the players] all the capabilities and possibilities physically, technically, tactically and mentally to cope with what's coming their way.\"\n\nHe added: \"That's the greatest challenge of all for me. Having conquered -- if you like -- the Premier League for so long with so many different clubs, this challenge is a much wider scope and much more challenging, but for me much more exciting.\"",

        "premise": "The pool stages of the Rugby World Cup provided an enthralling five weeks full of twists and turns.\n\nThere were upsets with Portugal beating Fiji, who had earlier knocked over Australia, while Ireland continued to show the world why they are serious contenders to lift the William Webb-Ellis trophy at the end of the month. Many sides impressed and there were plenty of excellent individual performances from both tier one and tier two nations.\n\nIf the pool stages are anything to go by the rugby fans are in for a treat as the World Cup knockout stages begin this weekend. Rugby correspondent Steffan Thomas selects his team of the tournament.\n\nREAD MORE: Wales' awesome gesture to hotel staff that have looked after them for a month as they leave for the quarter finals\n\nREAD MORE: Alix Popham: Dementia, 'emotional explosions' and the players still in denial\n\n15. Hugo Keenan (Ireland)\nThe Ireland full-back is probably the most complete number 15 in the world game. He hardly ever gets caught out of position while the Leinster star is also solid under the high ball, and in defence.\n\nThe 27-years-old is a tremendous attacking player who provides a counter-attacking threat from deep but also acts as a playmaker to release others into space. Keenan was outstanding during Ireland's victories over world champions South Africa, and Scotland while he will be crucial to their chances of overcoming New Zealand this weekend.\n\n14. Damian Penaud (France)\nArguably the most prolific try scorer on the planet, and has already crossed the whitewash six times during this tournament; more than any other player. Who would be against the Bordeaux B\u00e8gles wing from breaking the World Cup record of eight tries currently jointly held by Jonah Lomu, Bryan Habana, and Julian Savea?\n\nStreetInsider.com\nYellowstone Discontinued - Effective Immediately\ninvesting.com\nMeghan Markle Was Stunned To Find Out Prince Harry's Net Worth\nby TaboolaSponsored Links\nPenaud who on fire during the pool stages, and only needs half a chance to score while the 27-year-old also has a solid all-round game.\n\n13. Gael Fickou (France)\nThe experienced centre is one of the most well-rounded midfielders in the world. Fickou was outstanding in his countries opening victory over the All Blacks, and is a key player for Les Bleus if they are to be crowned world champions on their own patch later this month.\n\nHe is undoubtedly among the best defensive centres in the world while his distribution and his attacking prowess with ball in hand wins him a place in this side.\n\n12. Bundee Aki (Ireland)\nThe Ireland centre is playing the best rugby of this career and was phenomenal during the entirety of the pool stages. His battle with powerhouse South Africa centre Damian De Allende was worth the admission price alone, while he tore both Tonga, and Scotland to pieces.\n\nThe 33-year-old has developed a world class centre partnership with Gary Ringrose, and with Aki giving Ireland dominance at the gain-line while his offloading ability is also a huge asset.\n\n\n11. James Lowe (Ireland)\nThe 31-year-old is another key player for Ireland, and Andy Farrell will be desperately want him fit for their eagerly anticipated quarter-final clash with New Zealand on Saturday after he picked up an injury in the victory over Scotland. Lowe knows his way to the try line but he's so much more than a finisher.\n\nThe Leinster wing also acts as a playmaker while he has an effective kicking game, and is also prone to winning penalties at the breakdown.\n\n10. Johnny Sexton (Ireland)\nIt's hard to think of any superlatives which do justice to the supreme excellence of the 38-year-old Ireland playmaker. It's no exaggeration to say much of Ireland's World Cup hopes rest on the shoulders of the experienced outside-half.\n\nSexton's tactical excellence played a crucial role in overcoming South Africa and Scotland while his kicking game along with his distribution are also key components of his armoury.\n\n9. Gareth Davies (Wales)\nThe Scarlets scrum-half has had a real resurgence of late coming in from the international wilderness to cement himself as Wales' undisputed first choice number nine. Davies was instrumental in Wales going through the pool stages unbeaten with his game management, kicking game, and his strike running playing havoc with the opposition.\n\nBut it's his defence which is his point of difference with the 33-year-old putting huge pressure on the opposition with his line-speed.\n\n8. Caelan Doris (Ireland)\nThe 25-year-old was outstanding throughout the entirety of the pool stages, and really stood out against a ferocious South African pack. Doris is undoubtedly one of the very best back-rowers on the planet who is an explosive ball carrier, a relentless defender, a lineout option, and an absolute pest at the breakdown.\n\nHis work rate is unbelievable, and is a big part of why this Ireland pack is so formidable. Read my weekly column in our rugby newsletter\n\n7. Jac Morgan (Wales)\nThe Wales captain has been sensational throughout the pool stages, and the sky's the limit as far as he's concerned. Morgan is like a hybrid of Wales back-row legends Martyn Williams, Sam Warburton, and Justin Tipuric all rolled into one.\n\nHe is an inspirational leader who excels in every area of the game be it jackling, defending, carrying the ball, offloading or even kicking. His performance against the Wallabies was arguably the best of any player during the entire pool stages.\n\nWhen the the stakes are at its highest Morgan delivers.\n\n6. Siya Kolisi (South Africa)\nWhat a leader this man is. The Racing 92 bound back-rower lifts the performances of his teammates but he is a world class player in his own right.\n\nKolisi was superb throughout the pool stages, even in South Africa's narrow defeat to Ireland at the Stade de France, and is an absolute menace at the contact area. The 32-year-old is also a world class lineout forward, and will have a big role to play during the knockout stages.\n\n5. Thibaud Flament (France)\nThe France star is a phenomenal athlete. Flament is one of those players who has the perfect blend of athleticism and physicality in his game.\n\nHe excels at the lineout while his stats are very impressive defensive, and he gives his side real go forward in the tight exchanges. Flament was outstanding in the victory over New Zealand while he is a joy to watch while in full flow.\n\n4. Tadhg Beirne (Ireland)\nIf one was given the task of selecting a world XV the former Scarlets star would be one of the first names on the team sheet, and he hasn't disappointed during the pool stages of the World Cup. Beirne has such a profound influence on games, and has a habit of making key interventions at critical moments.\n\nThe 31-year-old has everything but it's his ability at the breakdown which separates him from the rest as he took South Africa apart in this area of the game.\n\n3. Ben Tameifuna (Tonga)\nYes, I'm aware I've left out Ireland's Tadhg Furlong but Tameifuna was terrific for an undercooked Tonga side. The gigantic tighthead prop, who plays his club rugby for French club Bordeaux, gave Andrew Porter a torrid time at the scrum when Ireland beat the Pacific Islanders a few weeks back, and he did the same for Scotland.\n\nFor a man of his size he was also prominent around the pack with is destructive ball carrying, and scored a well-deserved try against Scotland. Join WalesOnline Rugby's new WhatsApp Channel here\n\n2. Mike Tadjer (Portugal)\nThe 34-year-old Portugal hooker was a joy to watch as his country defied the odds to finish the pool stages with a stunning victory over Fiji, the best in their history. Tadjer has been outstanding throughout the pool stages with his throwing into the lineout as accurate as any other hooker in this competition.\n\n138437485146\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\npartner

        "premise": "William Woodward Sr. (April 7, 1876 \u2013 September 25, 1953)[1] was an American banker and major owner and breeder in thoroughbred horse racing.\n\nEarly life\nWoodward was born in New York City on April 7, 1876. He was a son of Sarah Abagail (n\u00e9e Rodman) Woodward (1840\u20131913) and William Woodward Jr. (1836\u20131889),[1] who came from a prominent and wealthy Maryland family that dated back to colonial times.[2] The family made their fortune in selling textiles to the Confederate government,[3] and his father was the founder of the New York Cotton Exchange.[2]\n\nHe was educated at the Cutler School in New York before preparing at Groton. He attended Harvard University, graduating in 1898, followed by Harvard Law School, where he graduated in 1901.[2][4] In 1901, he was admitted to the bar.[3]\n\nCareer\nFor the next two years Woodward lived in London where he served as secretary to the United States Ambassador to Britain, Joseph Hodges Choate.[4] There, he joined with other members of the political and economic elite including King Edward VII, at fashionable events including thoroughbred horse races, the favorite pastime of English royalty and nobility.[4]\n\nUpon his return to New York in 1903, Woodward was made vice president of Hanover National Bank in New York City by his uncle, James T. Woodward, who was then president of the bank.[3] Woodward's grandfather had helped James purchase a large portion of the bank years earlier before his death,[5] which the younger Woodward inherited, therefore owning a controlling interest in the bank.[6]\n\nFollowing his uncle's death, William Woodward Sr. became president of the bank in 1910, serving in that capacity until a 1929 merger with the Central Union Trust Company when he was appointed chairman of the new corporate entity called Central Hanover Bank & Trust,[7] and Central's president, George W. Davison, became president of the new entity. Woodward served as chairman of the board from 1929 until his retirement in 1933.[6]\n\nWoodward was one of the original directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914 and from 1927 to 1929, he was president of the New York Clearing House.[6]\n\nBelair and thoroughbred racing\n\nBelair Mansion\nWoodward also inherited the historic Belair Mansion and 2,500 acre Stud in Collington, Maryland. Belair is a very historic estate where Colonial Governor of Maryland Samuel Ogle had brought the first Thoroughbred horses imported to America from England in 1747.[8] His uncle James had acquired it in 1898 for an undisclosed sum of money.[9] Upon inheriting the property, Woodward built the Belair Stud into one of the dominant breeding and thoroughbred horse racing operations in the United States during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.\n\nIn 1925, Woodward joined Arthur B. Hancock, Marshall Field III and Robert A. Fairbairn to import the stallion Sir Gallahad III into the United States to stand at Claiborne Farm. Sir Gallahad III would become a four-time leading sire in North America and would sire 60 stakes winners, including nine for Woodward. Sir Gallahad III's most famous offspring was Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox, who would in turn sire Triple Crown winner Omaha, both bred and raced by Woodward.[10]\n\nHorses bred by Belair won every major stakes race in the U.S. as well as The Oaks, St. Leger Stakes, 1,000 Guineas, and other important races in Britain. Woodward's accomplishments in horse racing led to him making the August 7, 1939 cover of Time magazine.\n\nWoodward was elected to the United States Jockey Club in 1917 and served as its chairman from 1930 until 1950. One of the main efforts he pursued was the repeal of the Jersey Act, a regulation of the British Thoroughbred stud book that prevented most American-bred Thoroughbreds from being registered in the United Kingdom as purebred Thoroughbreds.[11]\n\nIn 1950, Woodward was elected an honorary member of the British Jockey Club.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1903, Woodward met Elsie Ogden Cryder (1882\u20131981) at Saratoga Springs, New York,[3] a daughter of tea importer Duncan Cryder and Elizabeth Callender (n\u00e9e Ogden) Cryder and one of the \"famous Cryder triplets\".[12] They were married at Grace Church in New York on October 24, 1904.[13] Elsie's younger sister Edith was the wife of Frederick Lothrop Ames Jr. and her aunt, the former Mary Hone Ogden, was the wife of Charles Francis Adams Jr. (the grandson of president John Quincy Adams). Together, they were the parents of one son and four daughters, including:[1]\n\nEdith Woodward (1905\u20131971),[14] who married Thomas Moore Bancroft in 1929.[15][16]\nElizabeth Ogden Woodward (1907\u20131986), who married Robert Livingston Stevens (1907\u20131972)[17] in 1928.[18] They divorced in 1935,[19] and she married John Teele Pratt Jr., a son of John Teele Pratt, in 1935.[20] After his death in 1969,[21] she married Squaw Valley Ski Resort founder Alexander Cochrane Cushing in 1971.[22]\nSarah Woodward (1910\u20131991), who married Charles Arthur Moore III (1909\u20131989) in 1936.[23][24] They divorced and she married Marshall Christopher Sewall (1908\u20131983) in 1949.[25]\nEthel Woodward (b. 1914), who married Philippe de Croisset (1912\u20131965),[26] a son of French playwright Francis de Croisset,[27] in 1941. His nephew was Count Philippe de Montebello and his sister was Marie-Laure, Vicomtesse de Noailles.[28] After having two sons,[29][30] Ethel and Philippe divorced and he married Jacqueline de la Chaume (after his death in 1965, Jacqueline became the third wife of actor Yul Brynner).[31]\nWilliam Woodward Jr. (1920\u20131955), who married Ann Crowell in 1943\u2060.[32] In 1955 Ann shot and killed William, reportedly thinking him a burglar. She later committed suicide in 1975,[33] after Truman Capote published a story that \"depicted her as a murderous vamp.\"[34][35]\nIn 1908, they lived at 11 West 51st Street in New York City and had a summer home in Mount Kisco, New York. Around 1910, they purchased The Cloisters on Ochre Point in Newport, Rhode Island, the former estate of Catherine Lorillard Kernochan, which had been designed by architect J.D. Johnston around 1885. The Woodwards hired New York architects Delano & Aldrich to complete a major renovation, which was completed by 1914. The home was torn down in 1950 and the site was divided into smaller parcels for contemporary homes.[36] The family also relocated from their 51st Street residence to 9 East 86th Street, which Woodward had purchased for $200,000 from William E. Iselin in 1916 and, again, hired architects Delano & Aldrich to design and build him a residence.[37][38]\n\nWoodward died on September 25, 1953, aged 77, at his home in Manhattan.[6] After a funeral at St. James Episcopal Church in Manhattan, he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx.[39] He left the estate to his son, William Woodward Jr., whose untimely death two years later in 1955 saw the end of Belair Stud. His widow, considered \"one of the last grandes dames of New York society\", died in her apartment at The Waldorf Towers, where she had lived since 1956, in 1981.[12]\n\nLegacy\nToday the Belair Stable Museum in Bowie, Maryland, highlights the work of William Woodward Sr. and others connected to the Belair Stud. The Woodward Stakes, a Grade II event now run at Aqueduct, during the Belmont at The Big A meet, is named in his honor.[40]\n\nIn 2016, Woodward was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame as a Pillar of the Turf.[10]",

That\u2019s the problem.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about geo-jurisdictions to start. What advice do you have for IT leaders when it comes to issues of data residency?\n\nThey need to perform comprehensive analysis and understand where the data will reside, and that includes evaluating where it\u2019s stored, computed, and moved. So, it\u2019s just a matter of getting those things clarified up front. You may discover you have multi-national or multi-jurisdictional policies and regulations such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or GDPR, or other regulations where it\u2019s multi-jurisdiction as well as your enterprise policies and regulations you must adhere.\nIn some cases, you run into problems when you can\u2019t even use the proposed software solution within your jurisdiction because it\u2019s just not offered.\n\nInteresting.

In some cases, you might even have data hopping across multiple jurisdictions, potentially.\n\nSo, everything has to be legal through all of that transit.\n\nCorrect. Legal and also just a level of being comfortable. For example, you might be willing to accept the risk of having the data moving through a country, recognizing it provides an additional level of redundancy or resiliency to your solution. So, the example I use in Canada is that by default, any phone communications typically run through the U.S. if there are any latency issues at all with the Canadian route.\n\nNow, if you have regulation or policy in place saying no data will flow through the U.S., you need to recognize that if there is a significant outage in Canada because someone with a backhoe took out one of the main fiber lines, that the level of resiliency is not going to be there. This means that geo-residency policies can impact the resiliency and reliability of the solutions.\n\nA great example of why you need to be aware of those considerations and try to make an informed decision. What warning do you give organizations that don\u2019t believe data residency is a concern for them?\n\nWell, it\u2019s kind of interesting, because in the E.U., when you talk to people, they say, \u201cWell, of course, the data\u2019s crossing our country boundaries, so why would you even be concerned with it?\u201d Right? In Canada, it\u2019s more of a concern, I believe with us being so close to the U.S., where we have the U.S. Cloud Act in place. You have U.S. disclosure orders in place with it. So we\u2019re a little bit closer to being aware of some of those issues, and it becomes political, quite often.\n\nI don\u2019t see it as being as big of a deal as what I know a lot of people see it as, because you should be encrypting your data anyway. So, if you take appropriate precautions and you are encrypting your data or tokenizing your data, so what?\n\nThat said, then it becomes increasingly more political. So yes, you\u2019re holding onto your encryption key, those encryption keys are staying within Canada or the token translation tables, are waiting within Canada. But, the actual data is residing in the U.S., then the only real concern is what if someone says, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to give you back your data.\u201d Right?\n\nAnother unlikely scenario is where you\u2019re dealing with data hosted in a country that you\u2019re on unfriendly terms with and they go, \u201cI\u2019m not giving you your data back, and I know it\u2019s going to have major economic disruption for you.\u201d Then, of course, that has to be a consideration. But, for countries like those under the Five Eyes International that have agreements in place and have similar cultures and business procedures, I don\u2019t think it should be that big of a deal.\n\nFor those unaware, the Five Eyes, (FVEY) is an intelligence alliance made up of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They are parties to the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, which is a treaty for cooperation in signals intelligence. Okay. Give me a high-level description of the U.S. Cloud Act. Why is it important?\n\nThe Cloud Act has two major elements. One element is that they provided clarification that the U.S. has the right to issue disclosure orders on any data centers outside of the U.S. as long as they follow the U.S.\u2019s judicial processes. This clarifies the fact that if you do have any U.S. data centers running in any country, then the U.S. can issue disclosure orders. This resulted from the Microsoft disclosure order years ago that happened in Ireland. There was a lot of confusion in terms of, could they ask for it? Could they not ask for it? What this act can clarify is, yes, they can ask for it.\n\nThe second interesting aspect, which I don\u2019t know if it has been thoroughly thought through, is that to my understanding is that any non-U.S. company or country can issue a disclosure order to a U.S. data center, as long as they have followed their appropriate judicial processes and procedures for such catered requests.\n\nOkay. So, a company in the E.U. could issue a disclosure order to a U.S. company as long as the E.U. country followed their legal requirements?\n\nExactly. And I can see that working reasonably, for again Five Eye countries. Where the cultures are similar and where the business practices are similar. But last time I read the text, and maybe it\u2019s been updated or has been clarified too, it didn\u2019t say that. So what if you\u2019re dealing with an adversary? Pick one. This adversary says, \u201cWell, we followed our processes.\u201d Which is stating, \u201cI don\u2019t like this guy; give us his data.\u201d And they say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s our process.\u201d And I think in some of those cases, the U.S. is probably going to say, \u201cWhoa, I don\u2019t think so. Nice try.\u201d\n\nYeah, it sounds like it\u2019s pretty much indiscriminate reciprocity. What advice would you give IT leaders as to how to go about doing a geo-jurisdiction analysis? How would you advise that they get started if they all of a sudden go, \u201cWhoa, we\u2019ve got data all over the place and we\u2019re operating in multiple countries with data centers in multiple countries.\u201d How would you advise that they begin the process of lining out and charting where all their data resides?\n\nMy recommendation would be to use the standards in place that help to categorize and classify the data. Because a lot of the decision-making and the options are going to be based on those categorizations and classifications. Categorizations such as, are you dealing with healthcare information or with air control traffic information? Or are you dealing with we\u2019re out on vacation information? And classification is more along the lines of types of security classifications and risk classifications.\n\nIs there a single point of reference where leaders can go to find all of this information and these standards?\n\nYes. One of the best ones is under ISO 19944, the data classification for cloud computing guidelines. They\u2019re updating it, and I had to review it in the last couple of days.\n\nHow have security requirements changed in this new environment?\n\nSecurity has gotten more challenging in the cloud, because of the fact you have more risk exposure points. If you think back in the traditional world, you could see where those were connected; they were physically connected, physically cabled. Or they were located within your firewall or your protective networks.\nIn the cloud world, now we\u2019re talking about more public IP interconnectivity. That brings additional risks and concerns around multiple exposure points that were not there previously. And there\u2019s a pendulum swing that\u2019s just starting to happen. You and I are old enough to recognize the pendulum continually swinging between centralization and decentralization.\n\nSo, the cloud plane was centralization. Well, now the pendulum swing\u2019s coming back to decentralization, and what\u2019s happening now is that organizations are recognizing some of the limitations of cloud, because of the connectivity constraints, sometimes the security constraints, sometimes the process constraints, where now they\u2019re trying to use decentralized capabilities such as edge computing and fog computing, where they compute in the storage and the different cloud services that are actually being hosted physically closer to the consumer. Or they\u2019re being architected in such a way that there\u2019s more of a distributed processing taking place rather than centralized processing taking place.\n\nAs far as security requirements go, when I talked to you in 2017 about CSAs and SLAs, I also spoke to the CIO of an American company called DryBar. And what he said was that they had drawn up their security requirements and required that all their providers comply with their security requirements. Is that something that you would suggest for other IT leaders?\n\nThis is where it gets tricky. So, for the U.S. government, they will mandate that if you\u2019re selling any cloud services to the U.S. Federal Government it has to be FedRAMP accredited and certified. That\u2019s how they have that assurance evaluated. Specific security requirements can vary so much where all of a sudden you\u2019re not going to get the value from the cloud services. If you say, \u201cHey, you have to meet our unique 300 security controls.\u201d What cloud providers have done is try to architect things at a high level of security, recognizing that then they can offer it at a reasonably low-cost point, because there\u2019s a standardized level of protection across the board. Most won\u2019t customize because it\u2019s going to have significant ramifications on their entire architecture.\n\nAre there sections of a Cloud Service Agreement (CSA) that you suggest people focus on more than others?\n\nSounds needless to say but my recommendation is to read them. Quite often there might be a significant gotcha within the actual agreement itself. It can be just in the section under Terms and Conditions, such as, \u201cWe will own your data.\u201d And you read that, and you think, \u201cWell, no.\u201d Walk away from that vendor. Quite often, there are significant gotchas in those agreements that aren\u2019t hard to find, just read them through, carefully.\n\nSure, can you give me another example of a significant gotcha?\n\nYep, another one would be, let\u2019s go in a slightly interesting direction. We\u2019re going to guarantee as part of our service level agreement (SLA) that you\u2019re going to have availability 100%. That rings an alarm bell in my mind. Because how can you guarantee that? At 100%? Then you read further into the definitions, and you realize how they calculate their availability. So, how organizations calculate the SLA metrics varies from provider to provider. Some providers might say, \u201cThe way we calculate it is as follows: If you are unavailable for ten minutes, we don\u2019t count that.\u201d You can have an average of 9 minutes and 50 seconds, and then they\u2019re up for 30 seconds and then they\u2019re down for another 9 minutes and 30 seconds. We classify that as 100% availability. So, you need to understand the number that they\u2019re providing and exactly how they are calculating it.\n\nThe other example that I use is, quite often in their SLAs and terms and conditions, it might have statements such as, \u201cWe reserve the right to stop any particular service or function at any time. Or, make changes to any service or function at any time.\u201d Those become challenging because you might have bought Product X because of specific services. You need to understand and have an excellent trust relationship with the provider. Because, if they have those types of clauses, then you need to be comfortable that they\u2019re not going to pull the rug out from under you and all of a sudden stop some of the services or API\u2019s that they had provided to you that have great value. You might be seriously leveraging them and all of a sudden they\u2019re gone in two weeks.\n\nNow, what are the odds that a provider is going to intentionally upset their customer base by doing some of this? You would hope they\u2019re performing appropriate analysis where they\u2019re not going to bother their customer. But, there\u2019s a level of trust.",

        "premise": "Gestalt psychology, gestaltism, or configurationism is a school of psychology that emerged in the early twentieth century in Austria and Germany as a theory of perception that was a rejection of basic principles of Wilhelm Wundt's and Edward Titchener's elementalist and structuralist psychology.[1][2][3]\n\nAs used in Gestalt psychology, the German word Gestalt (/\u0261\u0259\u02c8\u0283t\u00e6lt, -\u02c8\u0283t\u0251\u02d0lt, -\u02c8\u0283t\u0254\u02d0lt, -\u02c8st\u0251\u02d0lt, -\u02c8st\u0254\u02d0lt/ g\u0259-SHTA(H)LT, -\u2060STAHLT, -\u2060S(H)TAWLT,[4][5] German: [\u0261\u0259\u02c8\u0283talt] \u24d8; meaning \"form\"[6]) is interpreted as \"pattern\" or \"configuration\".[7] Gestalt psychologists emphasize that organisms perceive entire patterns or configurations, not merely individual components.[7] The view is sometimes summarized using the adage, \"the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\"[8]:\u200a13\u200a\n\nGestalt psychology was founded on works by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang K\u00f6hler, and Kurt Koffka.[7]\n\nOrigin and history\nFurther information: History of psychology \u00a7 Gestalt psychology\nMax Wertheimer (1880\u20131943), Kurt Koffka (1886\u20131941), and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler (1887\u20131967) founded Gestalt psychology in the early 20th century.[8]:\u200a113\u2013116\u200a The dominant view in psychology at the time was structuralism, exemplified by the work of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920), and Edward B. Titchener (1867\u20131927).[9][10]:\u200a3\u200a Structuralism was rooted firmly in British empiricism[9][10]:\u200a3\u200a and was based on three closely interrelated theories:\n\n\"atomism,\" also known as \"elementalism,\"[10]:\u200a3\u200a the view that all knowledge, even complex abstract ideas, is built from simple, elementary constituents\n\"sensationalism,\" the view that the simplest constituents\u2014the atoms of thought\u2014are elementary sense impressions\n\"associationism,\" the view that more complex ideas arise from the association of simpler ideas.[10]:\u200a3\u200a[11]\nTogether, these three theories give rise to the view that the mind constructs all perceptions and even abstract thoughts strictly from lower-level sensations that are related solely by being associated closely in space and time.[9] The Gestaltists took issue with this widespread \"atomistic\" view that the aim of psychology should be to break consciousness down into putative basic elements.[6]\n\nIn contrast, the Gestalt psychologists believed that breaking psychological phenomena down into smaller parts would not lead to understanding psychology.[8]:\u200a13\u200a The Gestalt psychologists believed, instead, that the most fruitful way to view psychological phenomena is as organized, structured wholes.[8]:\u200a13\u200a They argued that the psychological \"whole\" has priority and that the \"parts\" are defined by the structure of the whole, rather than vice versa. One could say that the approach was based on a macroscopic view of psychology rather than a microscopic approach.[12] Gestalt theories of perception are based on human nature being inclined to understand objects as an entire structure rather than the sum of its parts.[13]\n\nWertheimer had been a student of Austrian philosopher, Christian von Ehrenfels (1859\u20131932), a member of the School of Brentano. Von Ehrenfels introduced the concept of Gestalt to philosophy and psychology in 1890, before the advent of Gestalt psychology as such.[14][9] Von Ehrenfels observed that a perceptual experience, such as perceiving a melody or a shape, is more than the sum of its sensory components.[9] He claimed that, in addition to the sensory elements of the perception, there is something extra. Although in some sense derived from the organization of the component sensory elements, this further quality is an element in its own right. He called it Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t or \"form-quality.\"\n\nFor instance, when one hears a melody, one hears the notes plus something in addition to them that binds them together into a tune \u2013 the Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t. It is this Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t that, according to von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, while still retaining its identity. The idea of a Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t has roots in theories by David Hume, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Immanuel Kant, David Hartley, and Ernst Mach. Both von Ehrenfels and Edmund Husserl seem to have been inspired by Mach's work Beitr\u00e4ge zur Analyse der Empfindungen (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of gestalt and figural moment, respectively.[14]\n\nBy 1914, the first published references to Gestalt theory could be found in a footnote of Gabriele von Wartensleben's application of Gestalt theory to personality. She was a student at Frankfurt Academy for Social Sciences, who interacted deeply with Wertheimer and K\u00f6hler.[15]\n\nThrough a series of experiments, Wertheimer discovered that a person observing a pair of alternating bars of light can, under the right conditions, experience the illusion of movement between one location and the other. He noted that this was a perception of motion absent any moving object. That is, it was pure phenomenal motion. He dubbed it phi (\"phenomenal\") motion.[14][16] Wertheimer's publication of these results in 1912[17] marks the beginning of Gestalt psychology.[16] In comparison to von Ehrenfels and others who had used the term \"gestalt\" earlier in various ways, Wertheimer's unique contribution was to insist that the \"gestalt\" is perceptually primary. The gestalt defines the parts from which it is composed, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts.[16] Wertheimer took the more radical position that \"what is given me by the melody does not arise ... as a secondary process from the sum of the pieces as such. Instead, what takes place in each single part already depends upon what the whole is\", (1925/1938). In other words, one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notes. Similarly, in vision, one sees the form of the circle first\u2014it is given \"im-mediately\" (i.e., its apprehension is not mediated by a process of part-summation). Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars.\n\nThe two men who served as Wertheimer's subjects in the phi experiments were K\u00f6hler and Koffka. K\u00f6hler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist Max Planck (1858\u20131947), but had taken his degree in psychology under Carl Stumpf (1848\u20131936). Koffka was also a student of Stumpf's, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythm. In 1917, K\u00f6hler (1917/1925) published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees. K\u00f6hler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by \"sudden insight\" into the \"structure\" of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that Ivan Pavlov (1849\u20131936) and Edward Lee Thorndike (1874\u20131949) had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectively.\n\nIn 1921, Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, Growth of the Mind. With the help of American psychologist Robert Ogden, Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in Psychological Bulletin. It contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt school. Koffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at Smith College in 1927. In 1935, Koffka published his Principles of Gestalt Psychology. This textbook laid out the Gestalt vision of the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science, he said, is not the simple accumulation of facts. What makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structure. The goal of the Gestaltists was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structure. This meant that science would have to accommodate not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other \"scientific categories\": questions of order and questions of Sinn, a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning. Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beings.\n\nHaving survived the Nazis up to the mid-1930s,[18] all the core members of the Gestalt movement were forced out of Germany to the United States by 1935.[19] K\u00f6hler published another book, Dynamics in Psychology, in 1940 but thereafter the Gestalt movement suffered a series of setbacks. Koffka died in 1941 and Wertheimer in 1943. Wertheimer's long-awaited book on mathematical problem-solving, Productive Thinking, was published posthumously in 1945, but K\u00f6hler was left to guide the movement without his two long-time colleagues.[note 1]\n\nGestalt therapy\nGestalt psychology should not be confused with the Gestalt therapy, which is only peripherally linked to Gestalt psychology. The founders of Gestalt therapy, Fritz and Laura Perls, had worked with Kurt Goldstein, a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.[20] The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case, it is not identical to Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term \"Gestalt\" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the Gestalt psychologists would object to it;[21] on the other hand, Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.[22] Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most Gestalt psychologists emphasize that Gestalt therapy is not a form of Gestalt psychology.\n\nMary Henle noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association (1975): \"What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions\u2014often unclear and often incompatible\u2014from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is not Gestalt psychology\"[23] With her analysis, however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.[22]\n\nThere have been clinical applications of Gestalt psychology in the psychotherapeutic field long before Perls'ian Gestalt therapy, in group psychoanalysis (Foulkes), Adlerian individual psychology, by Gestalt psychologists in psychotherapy like Erwin Levy, Abraham S. Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in Europe. For example, a strictly Gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy, developed by the German Gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist Hans-J\u00fcrgen Walter and his colleagues in Germany, Austria (Gerhard Stemberger and colleagues) and Switzerland. Other countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments.\n\nContributions\nGestalt psychology made many contributions to the body of psychology. The Gestaltists were the first to demonstrate empirically and document many facts about perception\u2014including facts about the perception of movement, the perception of contour, perceptual constancy, and perceptual illusions.[14] Wertheimer's discovery of the phi phenomenon is one example of such a contribution.[24] In addition to discovering perceptual phenomena, the contributions of Gestalt psychology include: (a) a unique theoretical framework and methodology, (b) a set of perceptual principles, (c) a well-known set of perceptual grouping laws, (d) a theory of problem solving based on insight, and (e) a theory of memory. The following subsections discuss these contributions in turn.\n\nTheoretical framework and methodology\nThe Gestalt psychologists practiced a set of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.\n\nThe theoretical principles are the following:\n\nPrinciple of totality\u2014Conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a system of dynamic relationships. Wertheimer described holism as fundamental to Gestalt psychology,[9] writing \"There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole.\"[25] In other words, a perceptual whole is different from what one would predict based on only its individual parts.[9] Moreover, the nature of a part depends upon the whole in which it is embedded.[9] K\u00f6hler, for example, writes \"In psychology...we have wholes which, instead of being the sum of parts existing independently, give their parts specific functions or properties that can only be defined in relation to the whole in question.\"[26] Thus, the maxim that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is not a precise description of the Gestaltist view.[9] Rather, \"The whole is something else than the sum of its parts, because summing is a meaningless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is meaningful.\"[27]\nPrinciple of psychophysical isomorphism \u2013 K\u00f6hler hypothesized that there is a correlation between conscious experience and cerebral activity.[16]\nBased on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:\n\nPhenomenon experimental analysis\u2014In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.\nBiotic experiment\u2014The Gestalt psychologists established a need to conduct real experiments that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher fidelity, what would be habitual for a subject.[28]",

        "premise": "Abstract\nThe significance of the body has emerged as a vital yet neglected element in the transition from military to civilian life. The recognition of a military body enhances the understanding of potential pastoral and counseling needs among veterans beyond the mind and the soul. This article attempts to contribute to further knowledge about this topic, drawing from both theory and empirical research, in an effort to provide insights for pastoral care and counseling.\nIntroduction\nEvery service member has to transition from military to civilian life at some point in their life and a shared conclusion among numerous researchers is that the transition and reintegration into civilian life is potentially challenging for many service members. It may impact the service members\u2019 health, well-being, family life, employment and financial situation, and capacity for social interactions (Adler, Zamorski, & Britt, 2011; Beder, 2012; Blackburn, 2016; Bragin, 2010; Brunger, Serrato, & Ogden, 2013; Burkhart & Hogan, 2015; Jolly, 1996; Moore, 2012). One reason for this is that the military culture develops and rewards values, meanings, and practices which are different than civilian norms. It has been suggested that some of the major features of military culture are a collectivistic life, intense camaraderie, a rigid hierarchy and chain of command, uniform clothing, obedience, loyalty, mission focus prior to and during operations or deployment, and military-specific training, skills and vernacular to break the civilian taboo of killing other humans during combat (Brotz & Wilson, 1946; Hall, 2012a, 2012b; Huntington, 1957; Strachan, 2006; Verrips, 2006; Wilson, 2008; Woodward & Jenkings, 2011). This also implies that military contexts and cultures shape powerful personal narratives or storied identities that are not only different from civilian identities but are also a challenge for service members to reconstruct during the transition from military to civilian life (Grimell, 2018b). Additionally, in the aftermath of military service personal narratives can host a variety of internal struggles and psychiatric/psychological trauma which may never fully leave veterans and inhibit the mental return to how it was before enlistment (Coll, Weiss, & Yarvis, 2012).\nIn Scandinavia the estimated incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among veterans is low (approximately 5% in Sweden and Denmark) while in the USA it is much higher (approximately 20%), but comparing the incidence rate of PTSD across nations is not the only way to anticipate and approach potential needs for pastoral care and counseling among veterans (Grimell, 2018a). Moral injury (MI) (Litz et al., 2009) and spiritual injury (SI) (Berg, 2011; cf. Tick, 2005) are recently developed ways of understanding toilsome internal struggles in complementary ways which do not fall under the category of the clinical and psychiatric diagnosis of PTSD; however, there are major areas of overlap which need to be further addressed and researched (Drescher et al., 2011). The emerging field of MI has elicited particular interest in relation to pastoral care and counseling (Brock & Lettini, 2012; Graham, 2017; Stallinga, 2013).\nA reason for this development is that the complexity of the implications from deployment and combat among veterans have been better nuanced, recognized, and acknowledged in recent years. This development goes beyond a traditional reductionist psychiatric and clinical approach to recovery since the biopsychosocial model of human behavior seems to fail to fully resonate with the adversities and struggles generated by military service. These adversities are often magnified during reintegration into civilian society. This current research in clinical practice indicates that recovery from PTSD and MI may actually benefit from a complementary approach of psychological/clinical treatment and pastoral/spiritual counseling (Bobrow, Cook, Knowles, & Vieten, 2013; Koenig et al., 2017; Wortmann et al., 2017). This may not come as a surprise for pastoral and spiritual caregivers since forgiveness, reconciliation, and atonement for the individual\u2019s acts which transgress the inner moral code or violate the individual\u2019s relationship with God and their fellow human being are crucial aspects of most world religions, Christianity included.\nThis suggests that a holistic approach to treatment\u2014a biopsychosocial\u2013spiritual (BS) model (Berg, 2011; Tick, 2005)\u2014is significant for a potential recovery and healing which will resonate within the wholeness of veterans regardless of whether the issues revolve around PTSD, MI, SI, and/or the reconstruction of personal narratives or storied identities amid the transition and reintegration into civilian society. In this article I prefer to title this holistic BS model the mind\u2013body\u2013soul (MBS) model since it better resonates with the purpose of this article to highlight the importance of the military body for pastoral care and counseling among veterans. Using this approach, the mind includes the psychosocial dimension, the body host the biological dimension, and the soul encapsulates the spiritual dimension of a person. The concept of the soul in this model concurs with Graham\u2019s (2017) suggestion that the soul is the location of a person\u2019s most sacred aspirations and their deepest pains. It also represents the person\u2019s moral center or compass. The soul is contextually creative in that it is engaged in a dynamic integrative interplay between the individual, communities, and cultures. Graham also emphasized the intimate dynamic relationship between the body and the soul. Graham argues that the soul is an integrating center, and that personal trauma is not an isolated element of a person\u2019s life, but rather grows into an ongoing permanent substructure of the soul.\nThe importance of understanding the military body has become apparent to me recently as I completed a longitudinal and qualitative research project on Swedish service members transitioning from the military to civilian life (Grimell, 2018b). I suggest that the military body may be wrongfully neglected in favor of the mind and soul during discussions on veteran\u2019s reintegration into civilian life. In addition to this insight, a clinical diagnosis such as PTSD also manifests itself through somatic symptoms and reactions such as arousal, agitation, and increased heart rate and respiration. Taken together, the body represents an element of particular importance which can enhance the general understanding of veteran struggles. Despite this, the body is rarely isolated for exploration and discussion except when combat trauma results in amputation (Haynie & Shepherd, 2011). The purpose of this article is to widen the understanding of the body in relation to transitioning veterans and military personnel regardless of physical trauma. Insights into the bodily dimension may present new perspectives and avenues for pastoral caregivers and counselors when working with veteran or active duty military personnel.\nThis article will continue with an exploration of military identity construction focused on how a military body emerges, then it will present a number of case studies which highlight the body amid transition from military to civilian life, and it will conclude with a discussion of the implications for pastoral care and counseling.\nMilitary Cultures Shape Embodied Identities\nThere exists numerous military cultures (which encompass various values, meanings, and practices) and contexts (e.g., basic training, garrison duty, combat and noncombat deployments) among military units; therefore, there are many nuances and not \u201cone military culture\u201d or \u201cone military identity.\u201d Despite these differences there are also shared themes among different military cultures and many researchers in psychology and sociology agree that a common thread is a collective and anti-individualistic perspective, which places battle buddies, the group, and the community first (French, 2005; S\u00f8rensen, 2011; Woodward, 2008). Therefore, community, camaraderie, training, and operationalized values (i.e., loyalty, discipline, obedience, and endurance) are all traditionally accepted examples of military cultural phenomena (Brotz & Wilson, 1946; Hall, 2012a, 2012b; Huntington, 1957; Wilson, 2008) which work towards designing and shaping military identities. Additionally, researchers have suggested that another important component of the military identity is competence and expertise in professional skills, and a fictive historical kinship with previous service members (Woodward & Jenkings, 2011).\nFollowing these accepted examples, I suggest that the bodies of service members are one of the most important aspects of creating and maintaining military identities. The body serves as the vessel which by necessity must embody and perform military-specific tasks to a high standard. Ultimately, military service is predominately a physical endeavor and the military profession can only be mastered by shaping the body through performance-focused activities with military-specific meanings. The overwhelming emphasis on physical performance at boot camp or basic training is not an abnormality during military service, but actually represents the road to success in the military. Military identities are learned and developed via the body, and service members are regimented by physical performance (Thornborrow & Brown, 2009). The strengths of the body are saluted and promoted through esteemed values such as discipline, endurance, obedience, and the capacity to perform despite hunger, thirst, fatigue, and adversity caused by inclement weather, or even direct, life-threatening opposition in combat (French, 2005; cf. Goldstein, 2001). Conversely, the weakness of the body is one of the most feared and unaccepted conditions of military cultures, especially the more radicalized ones. Herein lies a major identified health challenge since service members are reluctant to seek mental health support when the bodily system is overly stressed because of the fear of stigmatization for being perceived by themselves or others as weak (Bryan & Morrow, 2011). Service members tend to maintain the image of physical and mental fortitude (i.e., the mask) as long as possible (Wertsch, 1991). Perhaps, if help was sought sooner and interventions were carried out earlier more severe psychiatric conditions could be avoided.\nThe researcher and psychologist Shay, has presented invaluable insights on combat veteran identity development through his books Odysseus in America: Combat trauma and the trails of homecoming (2002) and Achilles in Vietnam: Combat trauma and the undoing of character (2003). Shay presents two understandings of PTSD which are relevant for this article\u2019s position on the body in military contexts. Shay suggests that with simple PTSD the bodily system has adjusted to the conditions of the war zone and combat in order to survive, and that the body cannot readjust when transitioning and reintegrating into civilian society and life. The body remains in survival mode which was a natural adaptation to combat. Once the body has adjusted to war the body may continue to reflexively react to seemingly harmless triggers in civilian life. Complex PTSD includes the physical problems of simple PTSD, but adds the mental inability to trust people or institutions. Similarly, the pastoral theologian Graham (2017) suggests that MIs cannot be understood solely through a mental perspective but must also include the bodily dimension (cf. Capps, 2008).\nWhile the BS model suggests a holistic approach of interdependent and intertwined relationships it fails to recognize the prominence of the body in military personnel and their cultivated military identities. I suggest that utilizing an MBS approach has a hitherto unrecognized advantage when addressing veterans who have developed a salient military identity that is strongly linked with their physical military body. Unfortunately, the clinical and psychiatric paradigm of the Western world tends to highlight the psychosocial dimensions while treating biological concerns as mere symptoms of the mind. Instead, this article suggests that the body has a more prominent position during military identity construction and therefore has a larger impact on identity reconstruction following service. The remainder of this article will highlight the importance of the body in military identity formation and its implications during transition from military to civilian life.\nLeaving Military Service with a Military Body\nThe cases studies which will be presented in this section serve to highlight the importance of the body and physical performance in military cultures and identities. Furthermore, these case studies serve to advance how military bodies influence service members amid the transition into civilian life. Mandatory research information will follow in order to safeguard the academic integrity of the article and the cases. The cases to be presented were derived from a longitudinal research project titled \u201cReconsidering the Uniform\u201d (Grimell, 2018b). The research project was launched in 2013 and followed nineteen Swedish service members during their transitions from military to civilian life, and in some cases their return to part-time or full-time military service. The purpose of the project was to explore and describe existential and/or religious dimensions in identity reconstruction over an extended period of time due to the paucity of longitudinal, empirical, or theological studies in this area. The interview phase included three annual interviews per participant and occurred from 2013 to 2016.\nA snowball sampling method was applied in collaboration with a Swedish military regiment to accumulate a purposeful selection which included nineteen participants (sixteen males and three females) who varied in terms of age, rank, branches, mission experiences, and total years of service. Each and every participant was informed about the study by a letter of information which presented the background of the project (i.e., a need to gain knowledge about the process of transition among service members) and described the purpose of the project, formalities, research ethics, anonymity, and publishing. This letter was distributed by postal service or email, and the participants had to complete a response letter and return it. This response letter also served as the informed consent agreement. In the response letter the participants were required, among a number of things, to suggest a time and place to conduct the interviews.\nAll of the participants had voluntarily terminated their military service due to a range of factors including: disappointment in the employer; stagnation of professional/personal development; curiosity to explore new avenues in life; retirement opportunities; or completion of service contracts. More than half of the sample had been deployed to Afghanistan, Kosovo, or Mali. None of the participants had been diagnosed with PTSD.\nAll participants in this article have through the informed consent process and informed consent agreement given their approval to present their cases. Some of the presented details of the cases have been slightly altered or omitted to safeguard the anonymity of the participants (e.g., explicit information about regiment, unit, names of significant others, explicit studies, explicit work place/tasks, and so on). Their names are altered, but the ranks are correct. Narrative accounts from some of these cases have also been presented elsewhere (e.g., Grimell, 2017, 2018b, 2018c, 2019) but this article presents a unique focus and perspective on military bodies in relation to pastoral care and counseling.\nPlatoon Commander Lieutenant John\nJohn was approaching his thirties when he joined the research project and had served for about seven years in the Swedish Marines. John originally enlisted and found military service stimulating. Near the end of his enlistment John\u2019s platoon commander recommended that John continue serving in the Marines and seek an instructor position, which John did. After serving as an instructor for a period, he was again encouraged by his commanding officer to apply to the Military Academy to obtain a commission as an officer. John once again followed this advice, graduated from the academy, and went on to serve as a platoon commander. One of John\u2019s persisting memories which he repeatedly revisited during his interviews was the evolution of his body and physical capacity to perform and endure physical challenges. John described himself as very thin when he entered the military, but during his time in the military he had gained about fourteen kilos (30 pounds) of muscle. John had cultivated and shaped a powerful body that embodied his military identity, and was both explicit (i.e., narrative identity, unit affiliation, uniform, and rank) and implicit (i.e., illustrated and performed by and through his body). One of John\u2019s persisting memories was when he and his buddies endured an extremely demanding long-term exercise in pursuit of a position with a prestigious military unit. Their exemplary physical and mental endurance allowed them to overcome the obstacles in their path and culminated in their acceptance into the unit during a battalion ritual. This achievement represented the peak of John\u2019s physical training and allowed him to fulfill his dream of serving in this prestigious unit.\nIn addition to this exclusively military achievement John, individually and as part of a team, also participated in challenging, adventurous, and endurance-based civilian competitions with a strong resemblance to grueling military field exercises. One of the most significant aspects of his military identity was the continuous shaping and training of his body in various ways both inside and outside of the military context.\nThis identity followed John when he attempted to transition from the military into the university setting. During this transition he experienced identity confusion largely due to his peers and professors\u2019 criticism of the military community and its purpose. John perceived this as a personal attack, and he in turn criticized his peers. One purely bodily aspect of his critiques focused on the body of one of his civilian peers which John perceived as undisciplined. He compared this perceived weakness with his own ability to control his body under stressful academic situations in the classroom. His statements about self-control and physical discipline also served to implicitly esteem military culture over of civilian culture. After a time of failed adjustment to civilian life John aborted his transition from the military and returned to active duty service and a deployment to a war zone.\nMilitary Analyst Sergeant Emma\nEmma was in her mid-twenties when she joined the research project and had served for four years in the Swedish Marines. She had been deployed to Afghanistan and was serving as a military analyst when she decided to transition from military to civilian life. Emma had enjoyed the physical aspect of her conscription and continued military service. As she put it, she \u201ctotally embraced the physical part of the military identity.\u201d Over the years Emma cultivated new military bodily skills and utilizing these new military skills she began to participate in civilian competitions which were similar to military exercises in content and style. Emma recounted that the solution to the problems in her life, whenever they occurred, was to engage in physical training and enduring psychical activities.\nEmma transitioned from military to civilian life and eventually found employment as a police analyst where she could utilize some of her military analytical skills. She narrated that this job stimulated her on an intellectual level but completely failed to stimulate her on the physical level. Occasionally, Emma was incredibly frustrated by the absence of bodily performance and activities in her employment. She tackled this situation through physical training and by becoming a personal trainer in her free time.\nEmma described that her body was connected to her military identity as a Sergeant in an interesting way. Emma was required to talk in front of new groups of people at her office. She gradually noticed that she had changed her body posture from a casual civilian stance to that of a military professional (i.e., she stood fully erect, moved in regimented way, assumed the military \u201cat ease position,\u201d and talked in a different way). She titled this bodily change as \u201cthe Sergeant.\u201d While it was awkward for Emma to slowly discover this physical shift in response to nervousness, she also appreciated it since it facilitated her initiation of uncomfortable exchanges. Once she had become accustomed to the crowd she could revert to her civilian posture and put away the \u201cSergeant\u201d persona.\nEmma continued to serve part-time in the military reserves which she enjoyed. Emma narrated that this connection with the military made her transition much smoother than being left without any military connections.\nSquad Commander Sergeant David\nDavid joined the research project when he was around twenty-three years old and had served for over three years in the Army. His decision to leave active service was motivated by an injury to his back. The unit which David belonged to had high standards for the physical and mental performance of the individual soldiers and for the unit as a whole. The injury to the back gradually worsened and when David felt that he could no longer meet these high standards he decided to voluntarily end his service. This was a long and difficult process for David because he was living his dream as a squad commander in the unit. Therefore, he pushed himself to serve as long possible despite his injury in order to live up to his ideals of commitment, loyalty, and pride. David narrated that prior to his departure from the Army he felt that he would be worthless in civilian life and began to use alcohol to tackle his terrible anxiety due to the transition from military to civilian life. Once back in the civilian life, David struggled for two years to reintegrate into civilian society but did not manage to find a new identity, employment, or meaning. His bodily injury constantly reminded him of his loss and David could not get any peace of mind to continue adapting to civilian life. After two years, David\u2019s injury healed and his body was finally fit for military service. David immediately reenlisted, and he recounted that while the previous two years had been filled with darkness, he could finally experience the joy of being back in uniform which was his one and only priority, his life.\nPlatoon Commander Lieutenant Maria\nMaria was a platoon commander with eleven years of service when she joined the research project. She had a background in the Army and was in her early thirties. The transition to civilian life was a struggle for Maria since her military identity was salient and strongly integrated into her self-perception. Her military identity was also deeply embodied and inherently performed.\nMaria endured the transition and eventually reconstructed a new narrative identity with meaning within a civilian context. For some time, she had been employed by a civilian company to work with leadership development. Maria decided that it was best for her to fully leave the military life behind and have no military strings attached at all. Yet she testified that the military part of her, her military self, still existed three years after leaving the service, and still unexpectedly manifested itself while working in the professional civilian setting similar to the before mentioned example of Emma. According to Maria, her physical presence altered when this identity shift occurred and she adopted a different tone of the voice, a distinct physical bearing when approaching others, and a different way of controlling and leading others.\nIn contrast to Emma\u2019s experience, Maria discovered quickly in her new civilian profession that her previous military mannerisms associated with being an officer (i.e., firm, distinct, decisive, and result-driven) did not work at all for a female within a civilian context. Therefore, she had to develop a new embodied identity as a civilian employee which did not include her previously cultivated military features such as physical presence or commanding leadership.\nInterpreter Sergeant Helen\nHelen served for about three years in the Swedish Marines and was in her mid-twenties when she joined the research project. Helen had been deployed to Afghanistan where she had been engaged in combat multiple times. She emphasized how important and demanding the physical tests were for her, and for all her peers regardless of gender, during basic training. She had to work hard to pass the tests. In some rare instances, when the test was based on the body weight, she even outperformed her male buddies and this made her exceedingly proud. However, her male buddies were irritated by this fact and they bullied her by claiming that the one who scored highest on that test was from now required to carry the most weight in the platoon. Physical capacity and performance were so important in Helen\u2019s military culture that her performance challenged the expectations of the normative male body during this particular test and elicited a powerful reaction from her male buddies. Eventually, Helen left military service. But patrolling with heavy equipment during combat operations had created chronic muscular skeletal injuries. Ultimately, Helen\u2019s desire to physically perform created bodily injuries.\nSharp Shooter Private First Class Mattias\nMattias had served two years in the Army and was in his mid-twenties when he joined the research project. Mattias testified on the importance of the body in military service. He stated that the only thing that mattered in the military was how well one performed physically, and that one was valued for their physical capacity and performance. Mattias believed that service members earned the respect of their peers and superiors through demonstrations of their physical ability.\nTechnician Sergeant Erik\nErik had a background in the Navy and had served for about five years. His service included several deployments to Afghanistan and elsewhere, and he was in his mid-twenties when he joined the research project. Erik recounted that after his most recent deployment to Afghanistan his body remained in deployment mode. He stayed alert, on over watch, and was agitated and on the move causing him to have difficulty relaxing. The military tactical mode was not something that existed only in his mind, but was integrated into his body (e.g., in maneuvering a car, walking, and observing). It actually took several months for his body to gradually leave the deployment mode and return to the relaxed civilian mode which he had prior to the deployment. Yet Erik related that after this transition he still automatically reverted into a tactical military mode when he felt unsafe or exposed, for example, when walking home late at night. Then his body reflexively moved in a military way, he was more alert, and observant of people and his surroundings. Despite his transition, Erik experienced these shifts as very distinct alterations to his body and physical bearing.\nDiscussion\nA known, utilized, and promising approach to pastoral care and counseling is a narrative approach. It has for some time been advocated by esteemed pastoral theologians such as Capps (1984, 1998) and Capps and Fowler (2001). For example, the story model (Capps, 2001) suggests that the content of the counselee\u2019s story is of critical importance because both the challenges and the possibilities of change are inherent in the story itself. But this model also advocates that the self is supposed to exist independently of the story. These two maxims (of the four presented by Capps) are important in the consideration of the body: the challenges and possibilities of a military body can be explicitly illustrated in the story, but they may also exist independently of the story as implicit or hidden dimensions. Through these maxims four reflections will unfold in this section which presents explorative aspects of the body when caring for or counseling military personnel and/or veterans.\nFirst, a narrative approach to care and counseling rightly places the emphasis on personal stories. Yet there is also a danger with this focus because the body may not be so easily demonstrated through a story approach when the primary focuses of the narratives are supposedly the mind and the soul. However, this article, and especially the real-life case studies, has illustrated the importance of the body in military cultures and contexts. Most service members, regardless of gender, have had to struggle to develop their bodies in numerous ways to succeed within their military contexts. Veterans may show resistance to abandoning their military bodies amid civilian life. The military body may also become such a crucial part of their lives that such bodily dimensions become unconscious to various degrees. Additionally, there is a military cultural inclination to minimize or ignore both bodily and internal sufferings and injuries (Bryan & Morrow, 2011; Wertsch, 1991). The content of the care seeker\u2019s story may therefore not satisfactory address the importance of the body. This may in part depend upon the fact that the care seeker fails to fully see and narrate the role that the military body plays in his or her life. Traditionally, issues which cause military personal or veterans to seek out pastoral care and counseling are first and foremost ascribed to the domain of the mind (i.e., psychosocial dimension) or the soul (i.e., spiritual dimension), while the body may have an unrecognized but more important position than previously assumed. A somatic experience which is felt by the consciousness may not have its root in the mind or the soul but in the body itself. In correspondence to this potential bias or pre-understanding is the interpretation of the story made by the caregiver or counselor where too much emphasis may be placed on the mind and the soul rather than the body. This suggests that both the care seeker and caregiver may benefit by giving special attention to the role of the military body amid transition and reintegration into civilian society and life.\nSecond, the military body can be metaphorically described in many different ways, such as \u201cthe disciplined body,\u201d \u201cthe militarized body,\u201d \u201cthe enduring body,\u201d \u201cthe injured body,\u201d \u201cthe scared body,\u201d \u201cthe marked body,\u201d \u201cthe suffering body,\u201d or \u201cthe silent body,\u201d to name a few. All these titles can illustrate how a body has been culturally and contextually shaped by military service. This suggests that military personnel and veterans gradually become their bodies over time, and that other types of cultural bodies may take a very long time to cultivate after transition. It is not possible to just undo the military body, but as Capps (2001) implies, the self also exists independently of an embodied story. This suggests that in time a new embodied identity can be cultivated but this requires time, motivation, support, and courage. Since the soul is contextually creative and engaged in a dynamic integrative interplay between the body and the mind of the individual, communal life, and cultures there is the possibility of bodily change which may be of better service to a veteran in civilian life. But even if alternative identities are constructed, cases such as Emma\u2019s and Maria\u2019s illustrate that the military body may still exist independently of new personal narratives.\nThird, moral and spiritual injuries tend to be described to occur through violation or transgression of a moral code located within an individual, whether it is described as the mind (Litz et al., 2009), the soul (Graham, 2017), or the inner defining core of a person (Tick, 2005). Graham (2017) suggests that soul is an integrating center of a person, and argues that personal trauma is not a contained and isolated element of a person\u2019s life, but rather grows into an ongoing permanent substructure of the soul. Additionally, Graham emphasizes the intimate dynamic relationship between the body and the soul. Therefore, I wish to advocate the possibility that combat or military trauma may be closely linked to the military body and not just to the inner part or the soul of a person. Within religious traditions, rituals tend to focus on doing things with the body that can be utterly sacred actions that combine both bodily performances and the workings of God or other sacred agents (Ramshaw, 1987). This may serve as a reason for the potential of religious rituals as pathways to heal moral injuries recently articulated within clinical practice (Wortmann et al., 2017). It can too easily be assumed that rituals work predominately through the mind or the soul of a person, but the involvement of the body is also critical to the performance of rituals. Religious rituals can introduce a different cultural body type/expression (i.e., suffering, weakness, agony, and tears) than those found in military cultures and may facilitate healing and recovery among veterans. In addition, rituals illustrate another embodied story of life which may support bodily change, inner growth, and identity development among veterans alongside the military body.\nFourth, in the Bible there is wisdom to be found regarding ancient combat veterans and their struggles in both military and civilian life. Recently the Biblical Combat Veteran Types (Grimell, 2018d, 2018e) were developed using Biblical stories to introduce four responses to combat, including the Saul type (who represented the development of complex PTSD), the David type (who illustrated resilience), the Joab type (who developed MI), and the Uriah type (who demonstrated unfaltering adherence to warrior ethics). As the founder of these types I also suggest that these types represent different military bodies which may be introduced in care and counseling. The Saul type represents a combination of \u201cthe militarized body\u201d (skillful and efficient in battle) and \u201cthe agitated body\u201d (with unpredictable somatic arousal and aggression), the David type represents a combination of \u201cthe militarized body\u201d (skillful and efficient in battle) and \u201cthe aesthetic body\u201d (committed to alternate cultural expressions through dance, music, creative writing, and art), the Joab type represents a combination of \u201cthe militarized body\u201d (skillful and efficient in battle) and \u201cthe revenging body\u201d (because of MI and betrayal he sought vengeance for his dead brother by killing others), and the Uriah type which represents a combination of \u201cthe militarized body\u201d (skillful and efficient in battle) and \u201cthe disciplined body\u201d (that never fails to uphold the warrior\u2019s ethics).\nThe degrees to which these bodily types may be illustrated in real-life differ from person to person and they are therefore to be understood as broader categories. For example, Sergeant Erik had a hard time readjusting his body post-deployment, and showed a tendency towards \u2018the agitated body\u2019 which may suggest that if he had continued to deploy that it could have impacted his physical condition negatively. Furthermore, the David type suggests that military personnel and veterans may develop better resilience by the cultivation of alternative or creative bodily types beyond their military ones. A powerful lived military story does not exclusively bind a person to a military body. Rather, from the perspective of a soul which is contextually creative and engaged in a dynamic interplay between the body and the mind, communal life, and culture there is always the hope to explore the potential for bodily change resulting in the combination of seemingly paradoxical body types.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe MBS approach serves a holistic purpose to better address the distinct needs of military personnel and veterans. When service members leave military service, they do so with their military bodies, and how to help them adapt all aspects of their military identity to civilian life merits further investigation and reflection. Recently, several biblical stories about Jesus\u2019 healing have been reevaluated to focus on the role of the body, and this research has highlighted the intimate and interactive relationship between the body and the internal struggles and emotional wellbeing of biblical care seekers (Capps, 2008). This biblical insight applies to contemporary pastoral care and counseling for veterans, and pastors and counselors must be attentive listeners (Capps, 1998) for explicit or implicit stories about the body. Ultimately, healing and growth for veterans in their civilian lives may depend on bringing the body to the forefront of pastoral care instead of confining it to the margins of their identity.",

Of being a tournament director, he says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to push the boundaries.\u201d\nBrent McLaughlin at Glen Abbey, site of the Canadian Open, in 2015. Of being a tournament director, he says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to push the boundaries.\u201dCredit...Andrew Francis Wallace/Toronto Star, via Getty Images\n\nBy Curtis Rush\nJuly 25, 2017\nOAKVILLE, Ontario \u2014 Brent McLaughlin is a tattooed, leather-clad, Harley Davidson-driving, guitar-picking former roadie.\n\nHe can also \u201cgolf it up\u201d in collared shirts and khakis when he is serving as the serious, but not too serious, tournament director for Canada\u2019s PGA and L.P.G.A. Tour events.\n\nThose alter egos make McLaughlin, 46, one of golf\u2019s most colorful tournament directors, if not the most unlikely.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably not what you would picture in personality and background,\u201d said Dan Pino, the director of corporate communications for Golf Canada. \u201cBut he\u2019s not wacky. He just has enthusiasm across different areas.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMcLaughlin runs not only the Canadian Open, which begins Thursday here at Glen Abbey Golf Course, but also the Canadian Pacific Women\u2019s Open in Ottawa next month. This week\u2019s field features the British Open runner-up, Matt Kuchar, and 11 major championship winners, including Dustin Johnson and Bubba Watson.\n\nIn his office, clad in jeans, long-sleeve shirt and sneakers, McLaughlin looked out the window to a shuttle driver making his rounds, a scene that took him back to his improbable journey, which started on this very course as a range picker and driver in 1994.\n\n\u201cI have no reason to be here,\u201d he said with a grin.\n\nMcLaughlin, who grew up in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, on the eastern tip of Lake Superior, had his first motorcycle and his first tattoos by the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1993, McLaughlin toured Canada by bus as a roadie for the Barenaked Ladies, a Canadian rock band, but it was only a diversion. He was about to get married and have the first of two daughters. He needed to put down roots.\n\nAfter failing to land a job as a firefighter after college, he managed a health club. He hated it. But every Thursday, a group of managers would play golf, and McLaughlin started to consider it as a career.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\n45 Seasons in, \u2018Survivor\u2019 Faces Realities of a Changing Planet\n\nBuzz-Cut and Brave: The Chinese Women Who Defy \u2018Beauty Duty\u2019\n\nHow to Break Through When Your Teen Tunes You Out\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEvery golf club in the Toronto area turned him down. Desperate, on a cold winter\u2019s day, he took public transit to Glen Abbey, about 20 miles west of Toronto, not even sure it was open.\n\nWhen he arrived on the barren grounds, he ran into the head pro and his associate walking out of the pro shop.\n\nImage\nJack Nicklaus wielded a hockey stick Tuesday at the seventh hole at Glen Abbey, which the tournament director has given a hockey theme, complete with Zamboni.\nJack Nicklaus wielded a hockey stick Tuesday at the seventh hole at Glen Abbey, which the tournament director has given a hockey theme, complete with Zamboni.Credit...Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI basically begged,\u201d McLaughlin recalled.\n\n\u201cGuys, I\u2019ll do anything to get a job,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d\n\nBy the time McLaughlin got home, there was a phone message indicating there might be something for him. He began as a shuttle driver, a range picker and a starter. His competitive fire got him noticed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI was the best range picker you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said.\n\nMcLaughlin started getting more responsibility and, before long, was offered a chance to apprentice as a professional in the pro shop. He later taught at junior clinics.\n\nThen came opportunities to serve as director of provincial championships and national amateur championships and a position as Golf Canada\u2019s director of rules and competitions.\n\nOn the back wall of McLaughlin\u2019s office are framed certificates confirming him as an international rules official \u2014 for Golf Canada, the United States Golf Association and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews.\n\n\u201cThere are only three or four people in the world who are certified at the three highest levels of rules certification,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite an honor to have that.\u201d\n\nScott Simmons, who stepped down last fall as the chief executive of Golf Canada, promoted McLaughlin to the job of tournament director for the Women\u2019s Open in 2013 and also to the men\u2019s event in 2015.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTournament directors tend to arrive from a business background. Coming from a rules background, McLaughlin said, \u201cgives me a broader knowledge of how the competition runs inside the ropes.\u201d\n\nAs a tournament director, McLaughlin is known for pushing boundaries. Mark Dusbabek, 53, a PGA Tour rules official, also took an unconventional path to his golf career. He was in the N.F.L. as a linebacker for the Minnesota Vikings in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBut Dusbabek said he was \u201cboring\u201d compared to McLaughlin, and noted that he and McLaughlin were prime examples of how golf could function quite well without \u201ccookie-cutter types.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to do unconventional things,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cSometimes they pay off and sometimes they don\u2019t. But great leaders will take chances on things.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAware of golf\u2019s declining participation numbers, McLaughlin said: \u201cYou can\u2019t constantly just rely on your die-hard fan. We need to embrace youth. When you look at kids coming up now, there are too many entertainment options.\u201d\n\nOne of McLaughlin\u2019s bold ideas, which pays homage to Canada\u2019s hockey culture, is part of his effort to turn the Canadian Open into a party.\n\nA devoted Philadelphia Flyers fan, McLaughlin has given the par-3 seventh hole at Glen Abbey a hockey theme complete with boards, a Zamboni and rink-side bleachers and viewing decks.\n\n\u201cAs soon as that shot is hit, I\u2019d love this rink to become just as rowdy as the 16th hole at the Waste Management Phoenix Open,\u201d he said, referring to a raucous hole on the PGA Tour.\n\nEric Baldwin, the vice president for tournament business affairs for the PGA Tour, said the tour was open to the idea, though a few changes were made to maintain the integrity of the competition.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAll in all, it was well received by everyone,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nSteve Marshman, a consultant to RBC on its sponsorship of the tournament, said McLaughlin\u2019s laid-back approach and openness combined to give the bank the feeling that \u201cthey\u2019ve got a true partner on board.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got his hands dirty and right in the guts of this thing,\u201d Marshman said. \u201cBrent\u2019s always a let\u2019s-do-it guy and positive versus trying to find a reason why something can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nMcLaughlin\u2019s office d\u00e9cor suggests he does not take himself too seriously. He said his \u201cmost prized\u201d trophy was a most valuable player award from a 1996 ball hockey competition. There is also the faux Oscar he received at a staff Christmas party, calling him \u201cthe most likely to start a drug ring.\u201d\n\nHe often brings his 18-month-old Bernese mountain dog, Westley, into meetings, and the dog serves as the unofficial greeter once the tournament starts.\n\nMcLaughlin is such an avid hunter and angler that the grounds crew at Glen Abbey allows him to park an old retrofitted ice fishing hut on the grounds before he takes it north to his cottage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2012, when he bought the hut online for $250, the inside was useless and the lights did not work. But the belly was in good shape and so were the tires.\n\nAfter McLaughlin towed it to the golf course, staff members said it reminded them of the mobile meth lab used in \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d In a nod to the main character\u2019s alias, the sign-making operations team crafted the name \u201cHeisenberg II\u201d and installed it on the back of the trailer.\n\nThe PGA Tour, McLaughlin said, is well aware of his personality.\n\n\u201cSome embrace it and some are like: \u2018Oh, boy, here comes McLaughlin again. What\u2019s he going to do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I like having that reputation. You\u2019ve got to push the boundaries.\u201d",

Islamic terrorism may have been used and encouraged by Ali Abdullah Saleh to win Western support and for disruptive politically motivated attacks.[8][9] In 2011, in the wake of the Arab Spring, which spread across North Africa and the Middle East (including Yemen), Saleh's time in office became increasingly precarious until eventually he was ousted as president in 2012. He was succeeded by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who had been vice president since 1994.\n\nIn May 2015, Saleh openly allied with the Houthis (Ansar Allah) during the Yemeni Civil War,[10] in which a protest movement and subsequent insurgency succeeded in capturing Yemen's capital, Sanaa, causing President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to resign and flee the country. In December 2017, he declared his withdrawal from his coalition with the Houthis and instead sided with his former enemies \u2013 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and President Hadi.[11]\n\nOn 4 December 2017, during a battle between Houthi and Saleh supporters in Sanaa, the Houthis accused Saleh of treason, and he was killed by a Houthi sniper.[12] Reports were that Saleh was killed while trying to flee his compound in a car; however, this was denied by his party officials, who said he was executed at his house.[13][14][15]\n\nEarly life\n\nSaleh in his youth\nAli Abdullah Saleh was born on 21 March 1947[5] to a poor family[16] in Beit al-Ahmar village[17] (Red House village)[18] from the Sanhan (\u0633\u0646\u062d\u0627\u0646) clan (Sanhan District), whose territories lie some 20 kilometers southeast of the capital, Sanaa. Saleh's father, Abdallah Saleh died when Saleh was still young[19] and after he divorced Ali Abdullah's mother.[16] His mother later remarried her deceased former husband's brother, Muhammad Saleh, who soon became Saleh's mentor and stepfather.[19] Saleh's brother Mohammed was a major general and had three children: Yahya, Tareq, and Ammar, who all served under Saleh during his rule.[20]\n\n\nPrivate Saleh in the Imamate Army of Yemen uniform\nSaleh's cousin, Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar from the Al Ahmar family, which is also part of Sanhan clan is often confused with the same-named leading family of the Hashid tribe, with which the Sanhan clan was ally.[17] The Hashid tribe, in turn, belongs to the larger Yemeni parent group, the Kahlan tribe. The clans Sanhan and Khawlan are said to be related.[17]\n\nRise to the presidency\nSaleh received his primary education at Ma'alama village before leaving to join the North Yemeni Armed Forces in 1958 at the age of 11 as an infantry soldier, and was admitted to the North Yemen Military Academy in 1960.[16][21] Three years later, in 1963, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in armoured corps.[21] He participated in the Nasserist-inspired military coup of 1962, which was instrumental in the removal of King Muhammad al-Badr and the establishment of the Yemen Arab Republic. During the North Yemen Civil War, he attained the rank of major by 1969. He received further training as a staff officer in the Higher Command and staff C Course in Iraq, between 1970 and 1971, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He became a full colonel in 1976 and was given command of a mechanised brigade. In 1977, the President of North Yemen, Ahmad al-Ghashmi, appointed him as military governor of Taiz.[17] After al-Ghashmi was assassinated on 24 June 1978, Colonel Saleh was appointed to be a member of the four-man provisional presidency council and deputy to the general staff commander.[17][21] On 17 July 1978, Saleh was elected by the Parliament to be the President of the Yemen Arab Republic, while simultaneously holding the positions of chief of staff and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[21]\n\nGovernance in the Middle East and North Africa: A Handbook describes Saleh as being neither from a \"sheikhly family\" nor a \"large or important tribe\", but instead rising to power through \"his own means\", and creating a patronage system with his family at the top.[22] His seven brothers were placed \"in key positions\", and later he relied on \"sons, daughters, sons-in-law and nephews\".[22] Beneath the positions occupied by his extended family, Saleh \"relied heavily on the loyalty\" of two tribes, his own Sanhan tribe and the Hamdan San'a tribe of his mentor, the late president al-Ghashmi.[22] The New York Times Middle Eastern correspondent Robert F. Worth described Saleh as reaching an understanding with powerful feudal \"big sheikhs\" to become \"part of a Mafia-style spoils system that substituted for governance\".[23] Worth accused Saleh of exceeding the aggrandisement of other Middle Eastern strongmen by managing to \"rake off tens of billions of dollars in public funds for himself and his family\" despite the extreme poverty of his country.[24]\n\nNorth Yemen presidency\n\nSaleh in 1978\n\nSaleh in 1988\nOn 10 August 1978, Saleh ordered the execution of 30 officers who were charged with being part of a conspiracy against his rule.[17] Saleh was promoted to major general in 1980, elected as the secretary-general of the General People's Congress party on 30 August 1982, and re-elected president of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1983.[21]\n\nThe People's Constituent Assembly, which had been created somewhat earlier, selected Col. Ali Abdullah Saleh as al-Ghashm\u012b\u2019s successor. Despite early public skepticism and a serious coup attempt in late 1978, Saleh managed to conciliate most factions, to improve relations with Yemen's neighbours, and to resume various programs of economic and political development and institutionalization. More firmly in power in the 1980s, he created the political organization that was to become known as his party, the General People's Congress (GPC), and steered Yemen into the age of oil.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Saleh was under considerable international pressure to permit his country's Jewish citizens to travel freely to places abroad. Passports were eventually issued to them, which facilitated their unrestricted travel.",

        "premise": "1912-2012: The Department celebrated its Centenary in 2012 and held a series of events.\nScroope Terrace\n\nThe Cambridge School of Architecture: a Brief History\n\nby Andrew Saint\n\nSchools of architecture started in Britain later than in continental Europe and the USA. Before 1900 budding architects learnt their trade as articled pupils or assistants in offices, supplementing their knowledge in the Victorian cities with evening or day-release classes. The Edwardian years saw a stampede to create a proper system of architectural schools. Cambridge was one of them. It began in a small way and with a less vocational bent than the bigger urban schools.\n\nThe initiative to teach architecture in the University started with Charles Waldstein, later Sir Charles Walston (1856- 1927), classical archaeologist and twice Slade Professor of Art. Waldstein was a polymath who had been educated at American and German universities. There architecture and history of art were respected and systematically taught, unlike the older British universities. At Cambridge, art and architecture had been touched on only in classics teaching and in the intermittent lectures of the Slade professorship, established in 1869.\n\nWaldstein's original idea, first canvassed in 1904, was to teach architecture not for professional purposes but as part of a Cambridge liberal education.Nevertheless because of the strong demand for training, the scheme he put forward in 1906-8 included a vocational element. Among its supporters were William Ridgeway (1858-1926), professor of archaeology, and D H S Cranage (1866-1957), later Dean of Norwich, in charge of Cambridge's extra-mural teaching and a lecturer on mediaeval churches. The proposal for a diploma in architecture was coolly received by the University, which disliked the professional training element - always suspect in Oxbridge degrees. A 'preliminary examination' was approved instead. But no funds were voted and though the exam may have been held, no teaching took place before 1911 when Waldstein put in \u00a31,000 of his own money to get things going. By arrangement, he then resigned the Slade Professorship. It was inherited on a lifetime basis by Edward Prior (1852-1932). Prior was a Cambridge graduate and a notable Arts and Crafts architect. He already had a high local reputation, on the strength of what is now the Zoology Building (1899-1902). Effectively he was first head of the school, though never so in name.\n\nPrior delivered his inaugural lecture, 'Art Study at Cambridge', in May 1912. The text picks a path midway between the teaching of architecture as a practical building craft and teaching architectural history, ideas and appreciation to amateurs and scholars. That ambiguity was to be perpetuated; the Department in its early years is best interpreted as a combined school of architecture and art history. Teaching began that October under the management of a Board of Architectural Studies. There were three students in the first year, one of whom, Kenneth Cross (1890-1968) was to become an architect of note and PRIBA. Six joined the following year, including Graham Dawbarn (1894-1976) and Henry C ('Hugh') Hughes (1893-1976). The first instructor in design and drawing was Matthew Dawson (1875-1943), who commuted up from London. Practical and humanistic strands were blended in the curriculum. Lectures from Prior, Waldstein, Cranage and others were a strong point; the technical side, though present, was weaker. 'Architectural Studies' at this stage was not a stand-alone subject; its two parts, which took a year each, added up to half a Cambridge degree (without honours). The first premises consisted of a single room close to the Squire Law Library.\n\nThere was a hiatus during the First World War, when a modicum of research was carried on. Teaching resumed in 1919, the 'University School of Architecture' now establishing itself on the first floor of 75 Trumpington Street. T H ('Harry') Lyon (1870-1953) became the principal teacher of design, with Hughes and, briefly, Dawbarn as his assistants. Numbers rose sufficiently for Theodore Fyfe (1875-1945) to be appointed in 1922 as first full-time director of the school, and women began gradually to be admitted. The school moved to 1 Scroope Terrace in 1924. Prior's role dwindled from this time. Under Fyfe, a Scot who had worked on the first excavations at Knossos, the school's tone became more pronouncedly classical and professional. But it was always small and poorly funded, with low salaries for the staff. Indefatigably in the background of discussions about the design teaching throughout the 1920s was Beresford Pite (1861-1934),an architect as distinguished as Prior, who came up from London to lecture, The fine-arts side of the teaching remained strong, lectures being given by local academics including the psychologist of aesthetics Ernest Bullough. So the Department still combined the subjects of architecture and art history. This marked Cambridge out from other British schools of architecture. It was confirmed by the change in management from a Board of Architectural Studies to a Faculty Board of Fine Arts in 1926.\n\nModernism was marginal in the Cambridge school before the Second World War. The Art Deco-tinged alterations to Finella (1928), for the don Mansfield Forbes, the first such work in Cambridge, were by the Australian Raymond MeGrath (1903-77), who enrolled as one of the department's first doctoral students but failed to finish his PhD. George Checkley, a New Zealander appointed 'demonstrator' in 1925, built two modern houses in 1932 but then left. The series of fine local houses by Hugh Hughes are better tokens of the gradual evolution in fashion, along with his more firmly modernistic Mond Laboratory (1932) and Fen Court, Peterhouse (1939-40). These were designed with his younger partner Peter Bicknell (1908-95), who like Hughes became one of the school's stalwart local practitioner-teachers. Another such was Harold Tomlinson (1899-1951), who with William Parker Dyson rebuilt Cambridge's student auditorium, the ADC Theatre, after a fire in 1934.\n\nJames Macgregor (1889-1953), a Scot who had been in Lutyens' office before specialising in architectural education, came from the Edinburgh College of Art to succeed Fyfe as director of the school in 1937. On the eve of the war the course was still as yet only for the three undergraduate years, about sixty students in all. A diploma exam could be taken two years after graduation, but as yet there was no actual diploma course. Research, commented a survey of schools, \"tends to be looked down on,\" though \"the Cambridge School, perhaps more than any other, has the potential resources required for that architectural research, in the broadest sense, which is so necessary if modern architecture is to develop\". Bright students of the period included Edric Neel, Hugh Casson and the architectural fantasist Tom Greeves.\n\nDuring the Second World War the larger Bartlett School was evacuated from London to Cambridge and some joint teaching took place. Despite ambitious plans for the future, Macgregor and his staff found it hard to adapt to post-war conditions and the school declined. But outstanding students such as Edward Cullinan and Cedric Price still passed through. In 1946 a fine teacher and architect arrived in the shape of David Roberts (1911-82), who drew many good students into his Cambridge practice, as Hugh Hughes had done before him. Bicknell and Roberts were to be the backbone of the post-war generation of teachers who took it for granted that lecturers would build as well as teach. They regarded their offices as natural extensions to the classroom.\n\nAfter Macgregor's death, Parker Dyson acted as caretaker head of the school. A decisive change came with the arrival of Leslie Martin (1908-2000) as head of school and it's first professor in 1956. The appointment was a coup. Among the most prestigious modernists in the UK, Martin had confirmed his pre-war reputation as an avant-garde architect with the popular success of the Royal Festival Hall. His intellectual air suited Cambridge; he possessed a doctorate (then rare in British Architecture), he believed in reconciling science with art, and before the war he had headed the Hull School of Architecture. Martin combined teaching and research with an atelier-style practice run from his home in Great Shelford. He also had a nose for politics and exercised extraordinary patronage over major architectural jobs throughout the country, distributed on his advice among proteges and the many young architects whom he encouraged. though often remote from the daily life of the school, Martin excelled as a memorable and perceptive studio critic. In 1958 he was one of the instigators of the Oxford Conference which led to the radical reform of British Architectural education.\n\nThe school now reorganised the undergraduate years into a full Cambridge 'tripos' (i.e. honours degree), the Diploma following on in 1960. the establishment of the two-year Diploma altered the school's centre of gravity, stimulating greater sophistication in the studio. In 1960 too history of art began to be taught as part of a seperate tripos course. Just then history seemed less relevant to the creation of architecture. though it was still intensively taught to the architectural students, the methods of doing so had begun to diverge in tenor and scope from what art historians had inculcated. The divorce of the elements combined in the setting-up of the school began to be felt. Though the Scroope Terrace premises and library were still shared.\n\nTo house the increased activity an extension was added behind 1 Scroope Terrace in 1958-9, designed by Colin St John Wilson and Alex Hardy. Upstairs was for teaching, while below were a staff common room and four rooms for researchers. The brick-and-concrete idiom of the extension prefigured the 'Cambridge modernism' identified with Martin and his disciples, while flaunting it's own Corbusian pedigree. In cooler, Scandinavian guise it enjoyed a strong and long following in British architecture, running through from Martin's own Harvey Court for Caius College (1960-2), designed with Wilson and Patrick Hodgson, to such late examples as the Burrell Collection, Glasgow, by Barry Gasson, John Meunier and Brit Anderson (designed 1971, built later) and Wilson's British Library (1978-97). Perhaps the most polished specimen of this gentlemanly modernism in Cambridge is the eight-storey William Stone building at Peterhouse by Martin and Wilson (1963-4).\n\nTeachers and researchers of different hues were drawn to the school in the Martin era. Colin Rowe was an assistant lecturer for some years from 1958; Peter Eisenman came to write a doctorate in 1960. The school pledged its commitment to a continuous relationship between research, teaching and practice by inaugurating the Centre for Land Use and Built Form Studies in 1967, under the direction of Lionel March but with early personal involvment from Leslie Martin. The Centre's original goal was to apply geometrical principles to ground coverage and building form, with better housing layouts foremost in mind. This work influenced the thinking of such architects as Richard MacCormac. Research topics proliferated, as computer studies started to impinge on architecture. In 1974 following Martin's retirement the enlarged research team, by then located away from Scroope Terrace in Brooklands Avenue, was renamed the Martin Centre. Meanwhile in Scroope Terrace a full Department of History of Art was created to stand alongside the Department of Architecture in 1970, the two departments combining to form a Faculty of Architecture and History of Art. Under the guidance of Robin Middleton a joint Faculty Library now developed into the best such library in the UK.\n\nMartin's successor in 1973, W G ('Bill') Howell (1922-74), was already well known as the prime mover in the firm of Howell, Killick, Partridge and Amis and the author of such powerful Cambridge buildings as the University Centre (1964-7) and the Senior Common Room at Downing College (1966). After little more than a year Howell was killed in a road accident, to be succeeded in 1975, after an inter-regnum, by Colin St John Wilson, whose tenure continued until 1989. From the late 1960s there was growing variety and freedom in the studio teaching, occasionally culminating in unrest. It was still taken for granted that most of the lectureships would be taken by practitioner-teachers, exemplified over the years by such figures as Bruce Martin, David Thurlow, Bob Allies, Nicholas Hare, John Sergeant, Eric Parry and Nicholas Ray. But a growing separation between architectural schools and practice, with the former tending to cast themselves as self-sufficient powerhouses, was naturally felt in Cambridge.\n\nBy the 1980s the school's internal culture had taken divergent paths. On the one hand there was the science-style research culture of the Martin Centre, settled by now in Chaucer Road, undertaking contract research and appreciated within the University at large. Here, while studies of spatial form (under Philip Steadman and others), urban modelling (under Marcial Echenique) and acoustics (under Michael Barron) successfully continued, environmental design in particular was burgeoning as a speciality, led by Dean Hawkes. On the other hand as reaction deepened against the intellectual vacuity of much modern architecture, a more cultural reading of the subject developed at Scroope Terrace, reflecting the anti-instrumental concerns of Joseph Rykwert (briefly a reader), Dalibor Vesely and Peter Carl. While both wings generated masters' courses of the kind now common in schools of architecture, and both were represented in the studio teaching, the Diploma studios became favoured as a vehicle for speculation.\n\nBy the time Peter Carolin succeeded Wilson in 1989 pressures were becoming felt which tended ultimately towards the lessening of ideological differences. These were prompted by the weapon of the Research Assessment Exercise, which with increasing rigour allotted money to universities and departments on the basis of their success in research as judged by their academic peers - a process conducted with alleged objectivity. British schools of architecture, with their intensive teaching habits and subjective modes of assessing design, were not best placed to meet these criteria. But the Cambridge school did well enough in all the assessments up to 2001. In parallel with increased research income and activity, teaching was at a zenith in diversity and intensity during the 1990s, and staffing grew to reflect that priority. The undergraduate and Diploma courses during these years hardly rose in numbers, despite the extraordinarily high level of applicants - which has been maintained. But the number of graduate students and the opportunities available to them increased. Many Cambridge-trained alumni, whether in architecture proper or in one of the higher degrees, now went on to teaching and research careers elsewhere. One such was Catherine Cooke, who taught at the Open University and became the world's leading expert on Russian constructivism in architecture and design. On the research side, an important extra component had been added to the Martin Centre in the shape of the CAD lab under Paul Richens, while Robin Spence's work on natural disaster mitigation continued to flourish.\n\nBy 2000, when Peter Carolin retired, to be succeeded (after an interim period under Nicholas Bullock) first by Alan Short and then by Marcial Echenique, there were three masters' courses, including one connected with the innovative Cambridge University Moving Image Studio (CUMIS) under Francois Penz. An innovative interdisciplinary course (IDBE), run jointly with Engineering, had also been established for professionals already active in the construction industry. This, under the initial leadership of Giles Oliver, helped heal some of the wounds inflicted by the growing gap between teaching and practice.\n\nIn the longer term, the effect ofthe RAE has been to elevate the research work at the expense ofteaching time. Structures and appointments within the school in recent years have reflected this; personal professorships and readerships have expanded, and the successful bid for a research grant has come to be seen, on the arts as well as the science side, as the prime contribution a staff member can make. The biggest loss has been the withering of the practitioner-teacher tradition among permanent appointments. Nevertheless it must be added in conclusion that at no point over the past fifty years has there not been a disproportionate number of Cambridge graduates in the leading London offices. While the research tradition has been favoured, and the mix of culture and training with which the school begun is fervently maintained, most students who enter the school of architecture still do so to learn how to become practising architects, and many continue to be outstandingly successful in that field.\n \n\nNote: This essay was originally written for the Architecture Department's Compendium Exhibition catalogue in 2006.",

        "premise": "Phi Sigma Alpha (\u03a6\u03a3\u0391), commonly known as La Sigma, is a Puerto Rican fraternity originally established as the Sigma Delta Alpha Fraternity (Sociedad de Amigos) on October 22, 1928, at the University of Puerto Rico by 12 students and a professor.[1] Phi Sigma Alpha can trace its roots back to 1898 to the Union Hispano Americana,[2] as well as to the first ever Greek letter Hispanic-oriented fraternity, Sigma Iota, established in 1912.[3] By 1998 there were over 4,376 members.[4]\n\nHistory\nOrigins 1898-1928\nMonument of Sigma Iota's birthplace on the former LSU Campus\nMonument of Sigma Iota's birthplace on the former LSU Campus\n\n \nUnion Hispano Americana emblem\nUnion Hispano Americana emblem\n\nPhi Sigma Alpha traces its origins to a number of organizations including Phi Lambda Alpha. Phi Lambda Alpha fraternity was founded at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1919. The fraternity was the result of a merger of three societies: Pi Delta Phi Fraternity at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), founded in 1916; Phi Lambda Alpha Fraternity, founded in 1919 at the University of California, Berkeley;[5][6] and the Uni\u00f3n Hispano Americana, founded in 1898, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York. This last one was the first Latin-American student society formed in the USA;[2] A group of Latin American students organized the Uni\u00f3n Hispano Americana (UHA) as a cultural and intellectual secret society based on the ideology of Pan-Americanism.[7]\n\nAfter \u03a6\u039b\u0391 was organized, other societies joined it: the \"Club Latino-Americano\", founded in 1919 at Colorado School of Mines; the \"Federaci\u00f3n Latino-Americana\", founded in 1926 at Columbia University and which joined in 1928; the \"Club Hispania\" of Cornell University, founded in 1929, and which joined in 1931; the \"Club Hispano-Americano\" of Tri-State College in Angola, Indiana, founded in 1921, and which joined in 1929, and the Alfa Tenoxtitlan Militant chapter (founded in 1929) whose members had come from the former \u03a6\u039b\u0391 society in Mexico City, Mexico.[8]\n\nSigma Iota fraternity was founded in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on March 2, 1912, previously known as the Sociedad Hispano Americana, which was founded in the University of Louisiana in 1904. Between 1912 and 1925, Sigma Iota expanded rapidly in the United States, South America, and Europe. As a result of this, Sigma Iota became the first international Latin American-based fraternity.[9] Sigma Iota and Phi Lambda Alpha joined and became Phi Iota Alpha in 1931.[10] In 1932, Phi Iota Alpha reorganized and formed the Union Latino Americana (ULA) as its overall governing body, dividing their member fraternities in Latin America into zones according to the country they represented.[11]\n\nThe Sigma 1928-1934\n\nSigma History\n\nSigma founders and two of the first members to join\nSigma Delta Alpha fraternity was established by 12 students and a professor on October 22, 1928, at the University of Puerto Rico at the Glorieta Fabi\u00e1n. The founding members included Santos P. Amadeo (professor of law),[12] Juan Figueroa, Fernando Jim\u00e9nez, Hugo D. Storer, Joaquin Velilla, Victor M. S\u00e1nchez, Adalberto Carrasquillo, Diego Guerrero Noble, Samuel L. Rodr\u00edguez, Jos\u00e9 Laracuente, Charles H. Juli\u00e1, Gilberto del Valle and Gilberto Alemar.[8]\n\nOriginally the name Kappa Delta Alpha was considered but it was quickly changed to Sigma Delta Alpha. By December 5, 1928, they established their Chapter House where they began celebrating their meetings.[8]\n\nFor many years, Sigma Delta Alpha enjoyed a certain amount of notoriety not enjoyed by other student organizations at the university. Its membership included four of the most important student leadership positions at the university: the Yearbook editor, the senior class president, the Athletic Society president, and the ROTC Battalion Commander. Every activity sponsored by the school administration was consulted with the Sigma Delta Alpha chapter president at the university in R\u00edo Piedras.[8] In 1929, the Beta Chapter at the Colegio de Mayag\u00fcez (University of Puerto Rico at Mayag\u00fcez) was established;[13] thus the original chapter came to be known as Alpha.[14]\n\nThe union 1934 - 1939\nExternal video\nvideo icon You may listen to the \"Farola\" and \"Brindis Sigma\" with an introduction by Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot here.\nMain article: Union Latino Americana\nPhi Sigma Alpha had its first reorganization with the merger between the Alpha Boriquen Militant chapter of Phi Iota Alpha and Sigma Delta Alpha of the University of Puerto Rico in 1934. The Puerto Rican zone came to be when the Alpha Boriquen Militant Chapter was founded in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on March 4, 1934, by former members of Phi Iota Alpha.[15]\n\nUnder the conditions stated above, a movement came about to unite Sigma Delta Alpha with the Alpha Boriquen Militant Chapter of Phi Iota Alpha. It was not an easy task since many of the Sigma Delta Alpha members did not want the change or to alter their history. But the decision was made and thus the Phi Sigma Alpha Zone of the Union Latino Americana came to be.[16][17] A \"Zone Directive\" was created and a constitution was drafted, since there was no central body to control the fraternity.\n\nBy 1937, the ULA had several well-established and functional zones including:[16]\n\n\u03a6\u0399\u0391 - Phi Iota Alpha in the United States\n\u03a6\u039a\u0391 - Phi Kappa Alpha in Cuba[18]\n\u03a6\u03a3\u0391 - Phi Sigma Alpha in Puerto Rico\n\u03a6\u03a4\u0391 - Phi Tau Alpha in Mexico\nULA held its last Convention on January 7\u20138, 1938.[8] Delegates from the United States, Cuba and the Puerto Rico zones were present. At the convention, agreement could not be reached over the ideals of the fraternity. After the convention, each zone considered the matter independently. The USA zone decided that the ideals of the ULA ought to be Pan-Americanism (the unification of Latin America by a system of confederacy) and led its members towards a position of pro-independence as it related to Puerto Rico, while the Cuban zone did not reach a decision on their own and ultimately decide to go along with the ideals conceptualized by the USA zone.[8]\n\nThe Puerto Rico zone rejected this decision because it considered the introduction of political issues to be detrimental to the fraternity. Thus on September 25, 1938, the Phi Sigma Alpha Zone withdrew from the Union Latino Americana.[19] The ULA dissolved shortly after.\n\nThe era of growth 1939 - 1964\n\nPhi Sigma Alpha Pin\nLike the members of the Sigma, a majority of the members of the Chapter of Phi Iota Alpha of the University of Louisiana, disillusioned with character given to their brotherhood, withdrew from the Fraternity and, in April, 1939, founded Sigma Iota Alpha,[8] a fraternity composed of Latin students of that University. As it was to be expected this new grouping was received with distrust by the other Latin fraternal organizations at the university. Since Phi Sigma Alpha was organized in Puerto Rico with ideals similar to those of the Sigma Iota Alpha in Louisiana, and since both organizations were the product of almost identical former brotherhoods, negotiations were immediately started to merge the two brotherhoods into one. This was decided in a convention celebrated on September 10, 1939, at the University of Puerto Rico, organizing themselves as \"Fraternidad Sigma\" (Sigma Fraternity) with two ramifications: Phi Sigma Alpha Zone in Puerto Rico and Sigma Iota Alpha Zone in Louisiana (Later the USA Zone's name was changed to Phi Sigma Beta Zone and came to include other universities in north Louisiana).[8]\n\nThe Phi Sigma Alpha Zone was organized by a board of directors of the zone, the Militant chapter Alpha Boriqu\u00e9n of San Juan, and two university chapters, one at U.P.R.-R\u00edo Piedras and another one at the U.P.R.-Mayag\u00fcez (then known as the Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mecanicas de Mayag\u00fcez (CAAM)). Years later the militant chapters of Ponce and Mayag\u00fcez were also organized.[20]\n\nThe Sigma Iota Alpha Zone (Phi Sigma Beta) was made up of the Alpha chapter in the University of Louisiana. In 1941, the Beta chapter in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, was organized. It was composed of students of various nearby universities, including Georgetown, University of Maryland, University of Baltimore, Johns Hopkins, and George Washington University.[8]\n\nWith time it became increasingly more difficult to sustain a fully functional zone in the United States, while pretending it worked as well as the zone one in Puerto Rico. A reformist movement arose abroad that culminated in 1964 with the establishment of the Phi Sigma Alpha Fraternity composed of active and militant chapters that can be found in Puerto Rico, in the United States or abroad. Therefore, the model based on zones was abolished and eliminated.[8]\n\nThe era of progress and adaptations (1964)\nThis article is a part of a series on\nPhi Sigma Alpha\nFraternity\nHistory\nPresidents\nAssociations\nCategory - Wikiproject\nvte\nPuerto Rico felt economic boom of the post Second World War years, and this boom was also evident in its universities. Puerto Rican youth registered in Puerto Rican universities in record numbers, and the Fraternity, which acted as the suppliers of the union between its young people and an escape from arduous studies, also offered student housing. During the next two decades, Sigma enjoyed extensive enrollment in the original chapters as well as the new ones that were beginning to develop. While the baby boom effect declined dramatically in the late 1970s /early 1980s, it resurged at the end of the 1980s, and continuing until the beginnings of the 1990s.[8]\n\n\"Un Sigma es ante todo un caballero\"\n\nPhi Sigma Alpha Creed\nThe 1990s brought an era of mandated accountability of fraternities, partly resulting from the deaths of two young cadets of the quasi-fraternal group the \"Panthers\" of the ROTC in the CAAM,[21] and also a damages lawsuit perpetrated against another island fraternity. This brought forth a law, which can be found in Article 125 of the New Puerto Rico Penal Code, to control the initiation processes or \"hazing\" and to protect candidates.[22] The Sigma Brotherhood, which since 1959 had prohibited in its processes the use of the \"Pledge Paddle\", achieved another \"first\" from its prohibition of acts against the physical and mental dignity of the neophyte even before Article 125 was enacted.\n\nThe Sigma has continued its emphasis throughout the years on the areas of community and social work by its active and militant chapters which regularly take part in blood drives and fund-raising activities for different organizations. The \"Beca Sigma\" (Sigma Scholarship) program has been re-established and promises to offer young Puerto Ricans of scarce resources the opportunity to receive a university education.[1]\n\nOrganization\nThe fraternity's highest administrative body is the \"Junta de Directores\", or Board of Directors. This body is composed of two groups. The first is the \"Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo Central\" (Central Executive Committee) which includes the fraternity president, vice president and others. The second group is composed of the regional presidents, and the presidents and secretaries of all the fraternity chapters, alumni and active members.[23] All members have an equal vote. The Board of Directors meets several times a year, as convened by the fraternity president. As of 2010, there were six regions, with the ones in Puerto Rico named after their main city: San Juan Region, Guayama Region, Ponce Region, Arecibo Region, Mayag\u00fcez Region, and the USA Region, based in Florida.[23]\n\nHeadquarters\n\nCasa Club Sigma's main entrance\nPhi Sigma Alpha's main headquarters are located at the corner of Calle Mejico and Calle Chile in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.[1] The offices are located in the Alpha Boriquen Chapter's clubhouse, known as Casa Club Sigma. Its restaurant has operated uninterrupted since 1968.[24] Its activity halls are rented out for meetings and events held by many organizations.[25] The clubhouse has two main activity halls and two smaller ones, which can all be opened up to create one big room, or used individually.\n\nThere is also a bar and restaurant area, called Vale's Place, reserved for fraternity members and their guest. In the back of the Casa Club Sigma is a basketball court. There used to be a swimming pool as well, but it has been paved over to provide additional parking area. The main offices of the fraternity are on the second floor of the building. On the back is the Pub Sigma, which is used by the Alfa Omega Activo chapter for their meetings and social events.\n\nSigma Foundation\n\nSigma Foundation\nThe \"Fundaci\u00f3n Sigma\" (Sigma Foundation) is a non profit organization, established to offer Puerto Rican youth of limited resources and those of outstanding academical records the opportunity to cover part of their university expenses. Through different fraternity activities, carried out to raise funds, the organization seeks to be fiscally responsible as the basis to fulfill its philanthropic goals.[26]\n\nThe fraternity collaborates and contributes to different organizations, mainly to the \"Fondita de Jesus\", the American Red Cross, American Cancer Society and \"Centro Espibi\" in Mayag\u00fcez.[1] Various golf tournaments are held to raise funds for charities. The Beta Boriquen chapter coordinates one such tournament with the Mayag\u00fcez Rotary Club.[27] The fraternity has raised funds for Da Vida Caminando con Raymond (Walk-A-Thon) during the years the event was active, for the 2023 event they raised $25,000.00.

        "premise": "Abstract and Figures\nAs landscapes change, it is important to understand how attachments and meanings attributed to place may affect environmental quality and social well-being. To understand and apply sociological insights to policy and management efforts it is not sufficient to simply demonstrate that individuals or groups have strong emotional connections with a particular geographical locale. Rather, it is imperative to understand the implications of attachments, and meanings related to them. We focus our attention in this area on watershed management. Quantitative data are used to conduct an analysis of the interactions between place attachment, place meanings, and environmental concerns in a high-natural-amenity watershed in New Hampshire. Results from quantitative analyses important for understanding the dynamics between place attachment, place meanings, and various dimensions environmental concerns are presented. We find a strong role for place meanings, rather than place attachment, in predicting environmental concern, as well as an independent effect of place-transcendent fundamental values.",
