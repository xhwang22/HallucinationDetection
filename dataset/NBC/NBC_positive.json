He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, and Chicago White Sox. He won the 2009 World Series with the Yankees, beating the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nProfessional career\nArizona Diamondbacks\nBruney was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 12th round (369th overall) after graduating from Warrenton High School (Oregon) in 2000.[1] Bruney pitched in the minors from 2000 to 2003, Bruney was called up to the Diamondbacks on May 8, 2004,[2] and made his major league debut that day against the Philadelphia Phillies, tossing a scoreless ninth inning in Arizona's 8\u20137 loss.[3]\n\nBruney in his rookie year with the Diamondbacks posted a 4.31 ERA and struck out 34 batters in 31.1 innings.[4] In 2005, the Diamondbacks tried Bruney as their closer, and he saved 12 games in 16 opportunities.[4] Overall, the 2005 season turned out to be a poor showing for Bruney. In 47 relief appearances, he posted a 7.43 ERA in 46 innings.[4] In May 2006, Bruney was designated for assignment by the Diamondbacks.[5]\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nBruney with the Yankees in 2007.\nBruney was later signed as a minor league free agent by the New York Yankees. Bruney pitched for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers until being recalled by the Yankees.[6] Armed with an upper-90s fastball, mid-80s curveball and an aggressive approach, Bruney quickly established himself as one of the better relief pitchers in the Yankees' bullpen. Bruney finished 2006 with a 1\u20131 record and a 0.87 ERA in 19 games (20.2 innings).[4]\n\nIn 2007, he spent time on both the Yankees' major league roster and their Triple-A team. He ended the season with a 4.68 ERA in 58 major league games.[4]\n\nBruney reported to spring training 2008 having lost 20 pounds in the offseason, in addition to gaining speed on his fastball.[7] On April 25, 2008, it was learned that Bruney would likely miss the remainder of the season due to a fracture in his foot (Lisfranc) but he chose to forgo foot surgery in order to rehab the injury.[8][9] After spending time rehabbing in the minors, he returned to the Yankees on August 1 following the trade of Kyle Farnsworth.[10] On January 30, 2009, Bruney signed a one-year deal worth $1.25 million to avoid arbitration with the Yankees. He was slated to be Mariano Rivera's primary setup man going into the 2009 season.[11]\n\nIn 2009, Bruney spent part of the season on the disabled list with a 3.92 ERA and 1.51 WHIP in 39 innings pitched.[4] On June 13, 2009, Bruney criticized New York Mets closer Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, calling his antics on the mound \"unbelievable\" and saying that Rodriguez has \"got a tired act.\" Rodr\u00edguez responded after the Mets won that day's game by saying \"somebody like that, it doesn't bother me,\" and suggesting that Bruney \"better keep his mouth shut and do his job, not worry about somebody else. I don't even know who the guy is. I'm not going to waste my time with that guy. Instead of sending messages through the paper, next time when you see me at Citi Field, come up to me and say it to my face.\"[12] During batting practice the following day at Yankee Stadium, Rodr\u00edguez confronted Bruney on the field, pointing and shouting at him before teammates from both sides could separate the two.[13]\n\nBruney did not appear in the ALDS against the Twins or the ALCS against the Angels, but was added to the World Series roster.[14] On October 28, it was announced that Bruney would be replacing backup catcher Francisco Cervelli on the 25-man roster for the World Series.[15]\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nBruney with the Washington Nationals during spring training in 2010\nOn December 7, 2009, Bruney was traded to the Washington Nationals for Jamie Hoffmann, Washington's pick in the 2009 Rule 5 draft.[16] On May 25, 2010, the Nationals released him after designating him for assignment on May 17.[17]\n\nMilwaukee Brewers and New York Mets\nBruney signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on June 1, 2010,[18] but was released on June 21 after pitching 3+1\u20443 scoreless innings with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds.[19] Bruney signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on July 2, 2010.[20] Bruney became a free agent after the 2010 season ended.[21]\n\nChicago White Sox\nIn December 2010, Bruney signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox.[22] He had his contract purchased on May 30, 2011.[23] He made his debut with the White Sox on May 31 against the Boston Red Sox, allowing two runs in 2/3 of an inning.[24] On August 5, the White Sox designated Bruney for assignment.[25] He was released on August 15.[26]\n\nOn November 29, 2011, Bruney re-signed a minor league contract with the White Sox.[27] He was called up from AAA Charlotte on June 22, 2012, after Philip Humber was placed on the DL.[28]\n\nPersonal life\nAs a child, Bruney was an extra in the movie Kindergarten Cop.[29]",

        "premise": "Jimmy was born February 12th, 1977, to his parents (father) Kim and (mother) Pam Conrad in Arcadia, California. \nJimmy began playing soccer at the age of 5 years old and attributed a lot of his passion for the game being passed onto him through his grandfather. \u201d I initially kicked the ball around with my grandfather who was Danish. Born and raised in Denmark and he\u2019s the one who planted the seed of what was cool about the game\u2026 You could tell he was super passionate about it and as a kid, you gravitated toward that\u2026 I think he also had ideas of being a pro one day and maybe didn\u2019t get to live out the dream he wanted and passed away shortly after that photo was taken\u2026 so he never got to see me do anything.\u201d\n\nHis grandfather was very critical of his game growing up prior to passing. Jimmy stated, \u201cWhen I was 7 or 8, I just dominated\u2026 averaged 3-4 goals a game and was crushing it. The next year I got pushed up when I was playing against older kids, and I wasn\u2019t as dominant and he told my dad I had lost it.\u201d which followed a plethora of laughs amongst us. Jimmy stated, \u201cHe was very serious about how I was performing, and I knew it mattered to him and obviously I think he\u2019d be pretty proud of what I have accomplished.\u201d.\n\nIn regard to playing club soccer, Jimmy stated that from age 6 to 11 he played for AYSO and made a number of all-star teams (shoutout Region 98 & Live Oak Park). \u201cWe had a very good all-star team. We won the area tournament and the sectionals.\u201d.\n\nUltimately, Jimmy went from AYSO to club from 11-19 to playing club soccer. His last achievement at the club level was winning the U20 National Championship with the San Diego Surf.\n\n\u201cI played in high school as well and, to talk about high school soccer very quickly, a lot of people dismiss high school and that experience now.\u201d Then in reference to what parents and kids are thinking nowadays, Jimmy stated, \u201cOh, we have these academies\u2026and I don\u2019t want my kid to play in high school because the level is not high enough or I don\u2019t want them to get hurt\u2026and I think it\u2019s crap.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an academy player, you\u2019re on a team where everyone is close in level but when you\u2019re in high school, you have to raise the game of the players who don\u2019t play as well as you do so how do you do that? You have to learn these skills, which isn\u2019t just ability on the ball, it\u2019s also in how you talk to somebody that isn\u2019t as good as you. Do you talk down to them? Do you build them up? You have to learn these interpersonal skills and, not only on the field but off of it, too, because you don\u2019t want these players to feel like they\u2019re lesser than you. So they can be very delicate relationships, but I promise that they\u2019re going to help each player in these situations to go on to become better leaders because of it and I think that gets lost in the academy system sometimes.\u201d\n\nAlong with that Jimmy spoke on the pride of playing for a high school program. Jimmy stated, \u201cPlaying for your school hits differently than it does when you\u2019re just playing for an academy team that most people don\u2019t pay attention to. In high school, if you don\u2019t perform well against a rival, there\u2019s more pressure that you can\u2019t replicate in an academy. I know things will change, but there is a place for high school where these players can not only grow as players but as leaders and human beings.\u201d.\n\n\nJimmy Conrad is pictured above in his High School Yearbook.\n\nFollowing his youth upbringing, Conrad attended Temple City High School, in Temple City, California from 1989-1993. He was a four-year letter winner in soccer.\n\n\u201cI never won the league in high school! Which, sadly, is the only significant trophy I have never won. I won a national championship in club and college, I won MLS Cup, I won the Open Cup, I won the Gold Cup but in high school \u2013 NOTHING!\u201d\n\nFollowing his high school career, Conrad was looking to play in college and kept falling through the cracks at every corner. He was denied by his dream school UCLA and was searching for alternative routes to prove that he had what it takes.\n\n\u201cMy coach, Ron, called some schools on my behalf and managed to get on the phone with Sigi Schmid, the legendary coach of UCLA, and Sigi said, \u201cAll right, tell me about this kid.\u201d And Ron told him that I\u2019d be TWICE the player that UCLA All-American defender, Mike Lapper, ever was and Sigi laughed and said that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Though we could argue in hindsight that it was true!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, Ron got ahold of San Diego State coach, Chuck Clegg, and was so persuasive about how I was going to help the program, Coach Clegg gave me a partial scholarship without ever seeing me play!\u201d\n\nConrad accepted and attended San Diego State University from 1994-95. He played there for his freshman and sophomore seasons in 1994 and 1995 respectively for the Aztecs. \n\n\u201cI played pretty well during pre-season of my freshman year in the holding midfield spot but then, in the first game of the season, Coach Clegg put me as a striker because he didn\u2019t trust freshmen in important parts of the field so, after two years of that type of coaching logic, I wanted to get out.\u201d\n\n\nJimmy Conrad (#11) featured for the SDSU Aztecs. Freshman Season \u2013 1994.\n\n\u201cFollowing his sophomore season, Conrad got the opportunity to transfer to his dream school, UCLA! However, with no spot on the squad guaranteed, Coach Schmid said he would get him into the school but only GIVE HIM one week to tryout, Conrad managed to prove that he had what it takes to make the #1 college soccer team in the country at that time. He is now one of four players to successfully walk on at UCLA alongside some very familiar names in the US Soccer landscape in Cobi Jones, Steve Shak, and Benny Feilhaber.\u201d\nConrad played his last two years of college with the Bruins and helped them win a national championship his senior year in 1997, which was really a full-circle moment for him \u2013 from not being wanted out of high school by UCLA to starting in the final four years later and helping them win a coveted trophy!",

In 1961, he was posthumously enshrined as a coach in the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 7, 1897. Sachs attended Carl Schurz High School in Chicago, where he earned 11 varsity letters before his graduation in 1914. Upon graduation from high school, Sachs joined the United States Navy during World War I, where he continued playing sports, earning an All-Service team honorable mention in football in 1918 while playing on the Cleveland Naval Reserves football team.\n\nAfter the war, Sachs enrolled at Chicago's American College of Physical Education\u2014which later merged with DePaul University\u2014and graduated in 1923. While at college, Sachs played for the Chicago Cardinals in the National Football League (NFL) from 1920 to 1922.\n\nSachs was hired as basketball coach in 1923 at Loyola University Chicago, even while continuing his NFL career. From 1923 to 1926 Sachs played for the Milwaukee Badgers, Hammond Pros, and Louisville Colonels, ending his career as a player-coach for the 1926 Louisville Colonels, a road-only team based in Chicago. Sachs was also an assistant football coach at Loyola on the staff of head coach Roger Kiley.[1]\n\nAfter abandoning his NFL career, Sachs began to flourish as a basketball coach. In the 1926\u201327 season, the Loyola basketball team improved to 13\u20134. In 1927\u201328, the team set a new Loyola record for wins in a season by earning a record of 16\u20134. And in 1928\u201329, Loyola was a perfect 16-0 under Sachs' guidance. Loyola recorded 31 consecutive victories between 1928 and 1930.\n\nIn the 1930s, Sachs developed an innovative fast-break offense and a 2\u20132\u20131 zone defense that prompted a rule change in 1937 to prevent goaltending. His 1938\u201339 team was 21\u20130 before losing to 44\u201332 to Long Island University in the National Invitation Tournament final at Madison Square Garden.\n\nOn October 27, 1942, Sachs suffered a fatal heart attack while advising the Wendell Phillips High School football team for their appearance in the Chicago Public League championship.

Whitney said she tried calling back, but he never answered. The next morning, Chad failed to show up for an early morning meeting and never went to work. Whitney said the family became even more concerned when Chad's cell phone, wallet, van keys and a single flip flop were found left behind at his residence. In May, Anderson County Detective Darrell Slater released a video statement and said they had exhausted all efforts in Anderson and Knox counties, that there were many tips in the beginning, but they haven\u2019t led anywhere.

From 1949 through 1950, Davis recorded twelve tunes with a nonet consisting of other noted jazz musicians including arranger Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan, Lee Konitz, John Lewis, Max Roach and Kenny Clarke. The arrangements for that group were scored for instruments rarely used in jazz such as French horn and tuba. These recordings, which were labeled cool jazz and eventually appeared on the album Birth of the Cool in 1957 by Capitol Records, marked an important influence on the future of jazz.[2] He later signed to Columbia and released 'Round About Midnight on March 18, 1957. His acclaimed 1959 album Kind of Blue is generally stated to be the best-selling jazz album of all time,[3] although the data are not conclusive. The follow-up album in 1960, Sketches of Spain, went gold.\n\nHe formed his Second Great Quintet in 1964.[4] With the release of Miles in the Sky, Davis permanently abandoned hard bop, instead adopting jazz fusion and avant-garde jazz.[5] In this era he released the studio album Bitches Brew, which was certified platinum, culminating in the long electric jams from the mid-1970s released as Pangaea, Agharta, and Dark Magus. After a six-year retirement, Davis released albums under the Columbia and Warner Bros. labels during the period between 1981 and 1991. These recordings combined jazz with popular music genres as he turned more toward the mainstream.[6] He finished his music career with Doo-Bop, in which he experimentally combined jazz with hip-hop, his discography ultimately being extensively sampled in hip-hop, such as with beats from his 1972 album On the Corner.[7]\n\n",

        "premise": "David Barton (born January 28, 1954) is an evangelical author and political activist for Christian nationalist causes.[1][2] He is the founder of WallBuilders, LLC, a Texas-based organization that promotes pseudohistory about the religious basis of the United States.[3][4][5]\n\nBarton's work is devoted to advancing the discredited idea that the United States was founded as an explicitly Christian nation and rejecting the notion that the United States Constitution calls for separation of church and state.[6][7][8][9] Scholars of history and law have described his research as highly flawed, \"pseudoscholarship\" and spreading \"outright falsehoods\".[10][11][12][13]\n\nBarton is a former vice chair of the Republican Party of Texas and served as director of Keep the Promise PAC, a political action committee that supported the unsuccessful Ted Cruz 2016 presidential campaign.[14]\n\nEarly life, education, and family\nBarton is a lifelong resident of Aledo, Texas, a suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. He graduated from Aledo High School in 1972.[6] He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in religious education from Oral Roberts University in 1976.[15][16]\n\nBarton is married and has three grown children, including a daughter who performs minority outreach for the Republican Party of Texas.\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating from college, Barton served as a youth pastor at churches in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was employed as a teacher of math and science and eventually became principal at Aledo Christian School, a ministry of the charismatic church started by Barton's parents.[6]\n\nIn 1987, Barton formed Specialty Research Associates, Inc.,[17] a company which said it focused on historical research \"relating to America's constitutional, moral, and religious heritage\".[18] Specialty Research Associates submitted amicus curiae briefs in court cases.[19][20][21] In 1988, the company became WallBuilders.[18]\n\nBarton is the founder and president of WallBuilders.[22][23] WallBuilders publishes and sells most of Barton's books and videos, some of which present Barton's position that the modern view of separation of church and state is not consistent with the views of the Founding Fathers.[24] Barton has argued that the religion clauses of the First Amendment were intended only for monotheistic religions, and perhaps solely Christianity.[25] A 2005 Time magazine article entitled \"The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals\" called Barton \"a major voice in the debate over church\u2013state separation\" who, despite the fact that \"many historians dismiss his thinking ... [is] a hero to millions\u2014including some powerful politicians.\"[26] Barton has appeared on television and radio programs, including those of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and Glenn Beck. Beck has praised Barton as \"the Library of Congress in shoes\".[27] In September 2013, he returned to the political arena and advised state legislators on how to fight the Common Core academic standards promoted by the Obama administration.[28]\n\nBarton was the vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party from 1997 to 2006[29] under state chairman Susan Weddington. He has also acted as a political consultant to the Republican National Committee on outreach to evangelicals.[26][30][better source needed][31] There was a Tea Party movement to get him to run against Senator John Cornyn in the 2014 Senate election from Texas.[32] However, Barton announced on November 6, 2013, that he would not run for the seat.[33] Barton headed the Keep the Promise PAC, a political action committee supporting Ted Cruz during his campaign for election as U.S. President in 2016.[14] Cruz failed to receive the Republican nomination.[34] Barton has also advised Newt Gingrich.[29]\n\nBarton's first non-self-published work was a 2003 article in the Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics & Public Policy, (Volume XVII Issue No. 2, 2003, p. 399), a survey of Jefferson's writings about the First Amendment.[6]\n\nBarton is the initial funder of Patriot Academy, a right-wing organization that says it gives participants \u201cthe physical training you need to be able to defend your family\u201d and \u201cintellectual ammunition to defend the Constitution.\"[29]\n\nAffiliations\nBarton has served on the board of advisors of the Providence Foundation.[35] In an article discussing Barton, The Nation described the Providence Foundation as \"a Christian Reconstructionist group that promotes the idea that biblical law should be instituted in America.\"[36]\n\nAccording to Skipp Porteous of the Massachusetts-based Institute for First Amendment Studies, Barton was listed in promotional literature as a \"new and special speaker\" at a 1991 summer retreat in Colorado sponsored by Scriptures for America, a far-right Christian Identity ministry headed by Pastor Pete Peters, which has been linked to neo-Nazi groups.[37][38] Barton's assistant Kit Marshall said in 1993 that Barton was previously unaware of the anti-Semitic and racist views of these groups.[39] In September 2011, Barton sued two former Texas State Board of Education candidates for posting a video on YouTube that stated that he was \"known for speaking at white supremacist rallies\".[40]\n\nBarton has been a guest on the television programs The 700 Club[41] and The Daily Show.[42] In 2013, Barton appeared on Kenneth Copeland's Believer's Voice of Victory program where he suggested that abortion caused climate change because God no longer protected the environment as punishment for legalized abortion.[43][44]\n\nReception\nBarton has been praised by American conservatives, such as Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann,[10] Sam Brownback,[45] and Trinity Broadcasting Network president Matt Crouch.[46] By contrast, People for the American Way wrote, \"This guy is David Barton, a Republican Party activist and a fast-talking, self-promoting, self-taught, self-proclaimed historian who is miseducating millions of Americans about U.S. history and the Constitution.\"[47]\n\nHis work has been criticized by J. Brent Walker of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty,[48] Rob Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church and State,[49] Gordon College history professor Stephen Phillips,[50] Senator Arlen Specter,[11] the Anti-Defamation League,[51] Senior Research Director for the Military Religious Freedom Foundation Chris Rodda,[52] Messiah College history professor John Fea,[53] Baylor University historian Barry Hankins,[54] and Grove City College professors Warren Throckmorton and Michael Coulter.[55]\n\nAccuracy\nBarton's official biography describes him as \"an expert in historical and constitutional issues\".[56] Barton holds no formal credentials in history or law, and scholars dispute the accuracy and integrity of his assertions about history, accusing him of practicing misleading historical revisionism, \"pseudoscholarship\" and spreading \"outright falsehoods\".[11][12][13] According to the New York Times, \"Many professional historians dismiss Mr. Barton, whose academic degree is in Christian Education from Oral Roberts University, as a biased amateur who cherry-picks quotes from history and the Bible.\"[10]\n\nJay W. Richards, senior fellow at the Christian conservative Discovery Institute, said in 2012 that Barton's books and videos are full of \"embarrassing factual errors, suspiciously selective quotes, and highly misleading claims.\"[57] The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Barton's work as \"anti-gay\" \"historical revisionism\", noting that Barton has no formal training in history.[18] A number of writers have called Barton's work \"pseudohistory\",[58][59][60] though this designation has been disputed by Robert Knight of the evangelical Coral Ridge Ministries.[61]\n\n\"Unconfirmed Quotations\"\nIn 1995, in response to criticism by historian Robert Alley, Barton conceded, in an online article titled \"Unconfirmed Quotations\",[6] that he had not located primary sources for 11 alleged quotes from James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and U.S. Supreme Court decisions (hence, the title of the article), but maintained that the quotes were \"completely consistent\" with the views of the Founders. (By 2007, the article listed 14 unconfirmed quotations.)[62] In 1996, Rob Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church and State accused Barton of \"shoddy workmanship\" and said that, despite these and other corrections, Barton's work \"remains rife with distortions of history and court rulings\".[63] WallBuilders responded to its critics by saying that Barton followed \"common practice in the academic community\" in citing secondary sources, and that in publishing \"Unconfirmed Quotations\", Barton's intent was to raise the academic bar in historical debates pertinent to public policy.[62]\n\nIn 2006, Barton told the Texas Monthly, with regard to Jefferson's famous letter to the Danbury Baptists, that he had never misquoted the letter in any of his publications.

It tells the story of an introverted young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who is sent to live with his eccentric great uncles (Robert Duvall and Michael Caine) on a farm in Texas.\n\nPlot\nFourteen-year-old Walter is left by his irresponsible mother, Mae, to live for the summer with his reclusive, bachelor great uncles, Hub and Garth. Despite living on a ramshackle Texas farm, they are said to have a secret fortune amassed from past adventures and are the target of every traveling salesman. They, in turn, sit on their porch with shotguns, shooting at the salesmen.\n\nWalter is given a room in the attic and is not welcomed by his uncles at first, until they realize that Walter's presence annoys other gold-digging relatives. Walter persuades his uncles to try spending some of their money. Packets of seeds to plant a vegetable garden turn out all to be corn. The uncles then order a lion for a hunting target, but end up with a tame, retired circus lioness, who becomes Walter's pet.\n\nWhile loading fifty-pound bags of Lion Chow, Hub faints and briefly goes to hospital. Later, at a roadside diner, four toughs pull switchblades on Hub, but he easily subdues them. Hub and Garth bring the teens home to patch them up, and find that the elderly lioness has escaped her cage, claiming the cornfield as her new \"jungle\" home. Hub gives the teens a speech about growing up and being men before sending them home.\n\nA subplot develops around the photograph of a beautiful woman that Walter finds in the attic. Garth tells Walter the story of their past in the French Foreign Legion, during which Hub married an Arab princess named Jasmine, who was promised to a powerful sheikh. After living in constant peril from assassins, Hub spared the sheikh's life after a duel on condition that the manhunt ceased. However, Jasmine later died in childbirth and Hub returned to the French Foreign Legion, until he and Garth retired to their farm, where they are resignedly waiting to die.\n\nLate one evening, Walter trails Garth and discovers that his uncles have a room filled with money underneath the barn. On another night, Mae arrives with her latest boyfriend, a supposed private investigator named Stan; he claims Hub, Garth, and Jasmine were bank robbers and demands the money's location. When Walter chooses to believe Garth's stories instead, Stan pins Walter down and beats him. The old lioness emerges from the cornfield and attacks Stan; awakened by the noise, Hub and Garth find that the animal has died of heart failure defending her \u201ccub\u201d.\n\nThe next day, Walter leaves with his mother. Once on the road, Mae explains that Stan will be staying with them to recuperate. Walter asks her to \"do something that's best for me for once\" and abandons her. While Hub and Garth are delighted to see him back, Walter insists changes must be made: His uncles must involve themselves in his education and live carefully, as he wants them to die of old age.\n\nSeventeen years later, the local sheriff alerts Walter that his uncles have died after a failed stunt in their biplane. Walter returns to the farm and is given his uncles' will, which leaves everything to him. A helicopter bearing the logo Western Sahara Petroleum touches down near the farm, and a man steps out with his young son, explaining that he heard about Hub and Garth's deaths on the radio. He had recognized the names as the two Americans in tales told to him in his youth by his grandfather, \"a very wealthy sheikh\". When the man's young son asks Walter if his uncles really lived, Walter confirms, \"Yeah. They really lived.\"\n\nCast\nHaley Joel Osment as Walter Caldwell\nRobert Duvall as Hub McCann\nMichael Caine as Garth McCann\nKyra Sedgwick as Mae Caldwell\nNicky Katt as Stan\nJosh Lucas as Adult Walter Caldwell\nMichael O'Neill as Ralph\nDeirdre O'Connell as Helen\nChristian Kane as Young Hub\nDaniel Brooks as Sheik's great-grandson\nKevin Haberer as Young Garth\nEric Balfour as Sheik's grandson\nEmmanuelle Vaugier as Jasmine\nAdam Ozturk as The Sheik\nAdrian Pasdar as Skeet Machine Salesman\nMitchel Musso as Boy\nMarc Musso as Boy\nJennifer Stone as Martha\nTaureg as Jasmine the Lion\nBilly Joe Shaver as Delivery Truck Driver\nTravis Willingham as Hood\nClosing credits\nDirector Tim McCanlies, who was an admirer of cartoonist Berkeley Breathed, wrote requesting work of his to feature in the film.[2] Breathed sent the drawings of a strip called Walter and Jasmine, which is presented as the work of the grown-up Walter, and they also accompany the final credits.[3]\n\nCritical reception\nThe film holds a 60% approval rating from critics on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 137 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"A wholesome but schmaltzy movie.\"[4] On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[5] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[6]",

        "premise": "The genre of urban gothic literature emerged in America over the first half of the nineteenth century. Characterized by sensational descriptions of the crowded, crime-ridden antebellum city, these novels gave voice to widespread American anxieties about the accelerating pace of urban life. In particular, the urban gothic reflected concerns about the oppressive proximity and heterogeneity of the new urban cityscape. Crime, disease, and depravity of all sorts seemed closer, more multifarious, and more insistent, than ever before. By adapting the conventions of the older rural gothic, writers of this new sensational genre were able to both express and amplify these burgeoning anxieties about urban space and urban vice. Beginning with the writings of Charles Brockden Brown, the urban gothic mode reached its antebellum apotheosis with George Lippard, a labor radical who yoked gothic sensationalism to a sustained social critique of economic inequality.",

        "premise": "The Killers is a sensational urban gothic tale written by the journalist, novelist, and labor activist George Lippard (1822-54) in 1849. It exposes Philadelphia\u2019s class and racial conflicts and its gang warfare, criticizes corruption in government and finance, and lambasts the city\u2019s new experiment in incarceration, the solitary confinement system of Eastern State Penitentiary. Illustrated by the well-known artist Felix Octavius Carr Darley (1822-88), The Killers dramatizes and politicizes the social transformations overtaking the city in an age of mass immigration, industrialization, financial instability, and growing tensions over race and slavery.\n\nTwo members of the South Philadelphia gang, the Killers surveil the streets\nThis lithograph by J. Childs shows two members of the South Philadelphia gang known as The Killers that organized around 1846. (Library Company of Philadelphia)\nBy the time he wrote The Killers, Lippard was famous for the 1844 publication of another urban gothic novel, The Quaker City; or, Monks of Monk Hall, which was among the best-selling American novels before Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s (1811-96) Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. In The Killers, one of many \u201ccity mysteries\u201d inspired by the rapid expansion of urban areas and by French writer Eug\u00e8ne Sue\u2019s (1804-57) Mysteries of Paris (1842-43), Lippard depicts the disintegration of the family of Jacob D.Z. Hicks, a wealthy Philadelphia merchant. Hicks\u2019s illegitimate but pampered son Cromwell is disowned by his father thanks to his own profligacy and his mother\u2019s leaving his father. Hicks\u2019s wife, as she dumps him for an English baronet, reveals that his real son, Elijah, had been raised in a poor family (with Kate Watson, whom Elijah considers his true sister). Elijah is imprisoned in Eastern State Penitentiary for four years for passing a false note on a bank Hicks owns. When he discovers that Hicks is his true father, Elijah vows revenge for his abandonment, and to get it, eventually joins the notorious South Philadelphia gang \u201cThe Killers.\u201d By that time, the disowned Cromwell is the leader of the gang.\n\nThe California House Riot, which began on October 9, 1849 (election night that year), served as the real-life inspiration for the story. The California House, in the African American neighborhood around Sixth and St. Mary Streets, was a business owned by a Black man who had been rumored to be married to a white woman. It became the epicenter of a violent riot involving local African American residents, working-class Irish gangs, fire hose companies, and the city\u2019s police and militia.\n\ntwo killers characters reappear in Lippard's The Killers\nThe gang members Cromwell and Black Andy, key characters in The Killers, reappear here in Lippard\u2019s novel The Bank Director\u2019s Son. (Historical Society of Pennsylvania)\nThe riot is the climactic episode of The Killers, which describes it as having been triggered by a revenge plot created by Cromwell in cahoots with Don Jorge, the disaffected son of Hicks\u2019s Cuban partner in the illegal slave-importation trade. Don Jorge\u2019s father had been left to die by Hicks on an ill-fated slave-trading journey; Don Jorge befriends Cromwell and involves him in his own transatlantic slaving ventures, hardening him for the violent plot against Hicks to come. Hicks, reappearing after having gone underground for a few years, plots with Black Andy, the Black owner of a grog shop, to abduct Kate, who has caught his eye while working as an actress, for unnamed evil purposes. Thus exposing himself to the simultaneous revenge plots of Cromwell and Elijah, Hicks on the night of the riot finds himself imprisoned in the grog shop along with Kate. After Black Andy, defending his establishment, kills Cromwell, the Killers set the building on fire, ultimately killing Black Andy and Hicks\u2014but not before Black Andy saves Kate from the flames. Don Jorge meets his end in the act of looting Hicks\u2019s hidden hoard, shot by a gun in a booby-trapped box containing the records of Hicks\u2019s illicit trade in slaves. His death leaves the money to be snapped up by Elijah, who uses the funds to carry himself and his half-sister Kate to safety in Panama and then California.\n\ngeorge lippard's portrait\nGeorge Lippard, in this engraving by J.R. Telfer, wrote The Killers and other socially conscious works to highlight economic and racial inequalities in Philadelphia. (Historical Society of Pennsylvania)\nFour versions of George Lippard\u2019s novella The Killers were published between late 1849 and 1851; only the last, under the title The Bank Director\u2019s Son, bore Lippard\u2019s name as author, as previous versions had been anonymous. Few copies of The Killers and its related titles are known to survive, but versions are held at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania and the Library Company of Philadelphia. Three of the versions are identical with the exception of their titles. A short pamphlet edition of the text, The Life and Adventures of Charles Anderson Chester (1849), features many of the same characters but lacks the Cuban dimension of the narrative, and reads more as an indictment of gang violence than an attack on the corrupt elite in finance and governance. There are no known reviews of the novella, so it is difficult to say anything concrete about its reception, but the fact that it was issued several times suggests at least modest popularity in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Killers reveals a Philadelphia torn by conflicts over race, class, ethnicity, and visions of the city itself. At the same time, its idealism and passages of historical description\u2013woven into the narrative at a series of well-known Philadelphia sites\u2014exhibit a sense of pride and the persistence of utopian hope in the city that characterize it from its earliest days. And while its sketches of Philadelphia and its denizens are cast in the chiaroscuro of the urban gothic, they, together with the various editions\u2019 illustrations, provide a vivid sense of the city\u2019s mid-century social topography.\n\nMatt Cohen is Associate Professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin and a contributing editor at the online Walt Whitman Archive. With Edlie Wong, he edited Lippard\u2019s The Killers with the University of Pennsylvania Press (2014). (Author information current at time of publication.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2015, Rutgers University\n\nGallery\n\nTwo of the Killers\n\nLibrary Company of Philadelphia\n\n\nThis 1848 lithograph published by J. Childs illustrates two nameless members of the South Philadelphia gang known as the Killers. They are dressed in their ostentatious tails and plaid pantaloons, and one wears a similarly \u201cprecocious beard\u201d that Lippard\u2019s character Cromwell bears on his chin. His comrade sits on a fire hydrant, repeating a posture found on the cover page of The Killers. The South Philadelphia Irish gang was historically associated with the Moyamensing Hose Company. The man also wears a pin that holds a single initial, \u201ck,\u201d below his collar, perhaps solidifying his associations. The signage behind the men advertises a local auction and a circus put on by the famous performer Dan Rice. Rice was a household name in pre-Civil War times and rivaled Phineas Taylor Barnum of Barnum & Bailey fame. This scene retells the surveilling presence of the historic Killers in their territory.\n\n\nCover Page of The Killers\n\nHistorical Society of Pennsylvania\n\nThis cover page of George Lippard\u2019s The Killers likely shows two members representing the real South Philadelphia gang known as the Killers. The Irish gang that ruled the Moyamensing neighborhood in the 1840s was also known for its business in the fire hose industry. In this lithograph, one figure sits upon the nineteenth-century version of a fire hydrant, suggesting their allegiance to the organization. Their dress closely resembles an 1848 print by J. Childs of two members of the Killers gang, which also matches a description of Lippard\u2019s antagonist, Cromwell Hicks, in the beginning of the novel. Three main characters, including Cromwell, are listed for their pivotal involvement in Lippard\u2019s sensational retelling of the California House Riot that occurred in South Philadelphia on the night of the 1849 election. Lippard and his socially conscious works of historical fiction rose in popularity to outsell his contemporary, Edgar Allan Poe.\n\n\nGeorge Lippard Portrait\n\nHistorical Society of Pennsylvania\n\nThis portrait of author George Lippard is an engraving done by the artist J. R. Telfer in 1922, over sixty years after Lippard\u2019s death. Lippard was born on a farm in Chester County, Pennsylvania, where he lived until his parents were too ill to maintain the homestead and relocated to Philadelphia. George was raised in the home of his grandfather and two aunts, where he was groomed to work in the Methodist ministry, which he found did not meet his moral standards in practice. He then began training to become a lawyer, which also caused him moral reservation. An unemployed Lippard wrote in the popular gothic romance style and saw his social and financial standings rise from impoverished beginnings. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s societal and economic tensions were heightened as a result of the economic and political maneuvering of the powerful elite. Lippard sought to record the social disparities he witnessed in Philadelphia, while maintaining his sensationalist voice in retellings of contemporary history.\n\n\nEastern State Penitentiary\n\nHistorical Society of Pennsylvania\n\nLippard\u2019s working-class hero, Elijah Watson, is introduced in his solitary cell at Eastern State Penitentiary, located on Fairmount Avenue at Twenty-First Street. By the first publication of The Killers in 1849, Quaker-inspired Eastern State had become the model for prison reform in the United States, having introduced the new Pennsylvania System at its 1829 opening. In this lithographic etching, the Gothic architecture of the prison appears even more eerie under the rolling, gray clouds. The prison's design direction was intended to instill fear and regret in would-be criminals. While Lippard\u2019s socialist leanings aligned with Quaker social values of equality and peace, the Quaker methods of penitence ultimately failed to resolve the larger issue of incarceration rates among the poor.\n\n\nCromwell and Black Andy\n\nHistorical Society of Pennsylvania\n\nLippard\u2019s 1851 novel The Bank Director\u2019s Son shares the characters of Cromwell, \u201cBulgine,\u201d and Kate Watson that appear in The Killers. The text with this image recounts a retelling of Cromwell witnessing a murder carried out by Black Andy. Irish immigrants flooded the resident population of free African Americans who lived between Fifth and Ninth Streets and South and Fitzwater Streets in South Philadelphia. Tensions climaxed in the two-day riot at the California House at Sixth and St. Mary Streets when the Killers responded to a rumored interracial couple residing there. Interracial ties reappear in the presence of the black character and the Irish damsel, Kate Watson, in The Bank Director\u2019s Son. Lippard chronicled these racial tensions in a serial release of a version of The Killers that appeared in his self-published weekly paper, The Quaker City. The adapted Cromwell presented in this illustration appears again in the same dress described in the first pages of The Killers. Here we can see his white shirt and dark tie pairing, as well as the plaid pantaloons explained by Lippard in his introductions of Cromwell and Don Jorge as college students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\nThemes\nCorrupt and Contented City of Brotherly Love\nTime Periods\nNineteenth Century to 1854\nLocations\nSouth Philadelphia\nEssays\nBookselling Book Publishing and Publishers Gothic Literature Quaker City (The); Or, the Monks of Monk Hall Riots (1830s and 1840s) Eastern State Penitentiary\nRelated Reading\nAnonymous [George Lippard].

Indeed, to insiders the very word \"\"metatheatre,\"\" coined by Lionel Abel, has become as familiar as the plays the author uses to exemplify his theory. Abel's basic premise is that \"\"tragedy is difficult if not altogether impossible for the modern dramatist.\"\" Having identified the modern, existential dilemma (for both playwright and audience), Abel sets out to provide a theory for its resolution. In doing so he illuminates plays by Sophocles, Shakespeare, Calderon, Racine, Wilde, Genet, Brecht, Beckett, Pirandello, and others with ease and probity, offering a new generation of readers fresh, insightful interpretations. And if anyone thinks Lionel Abel has tempered his style be forewarned: As in his opening critique of those he considers to be playing \"\"language games,\"\" his criticism remains as piercing as ever.",

        "premise": "What follows is a short history of the major influences that have combined to create mountain music. By using these notes and David Holt\u2019s recordings one can get an overview of history and sounds of this unique music. All music examples are from David\u2019s recordings: I Got A Bullfrog (BF), Reel And Rock (RR) and Grandfather\u2019s Greatest Hits (GGH). The words to the songs follow these notes so that you can sing along if you choose.\n\nThe Southern Mountains has long held the image of a place very slow to change. The mountains create a natural isolation and the people there are notoriously conservative, eager to hold on to tradition. Likewise, when people think of traditional mountain folksongs, they naturally think of an unchanging, static music with few outside influences. But all the major influences that effected other music in America also effected the styles of traditional mountain music. In most parts of America songs of the Civil War, the minstrel and medicine shows, and early vaudeville have long since disappeared. In the Southern Mountains these and other now obscure musical genres are still thriving in the traditional folk music of the region. The Southern Mountains is a microcosm of the musical influences that have occurred throughout the United States in the last two hundred years, but have long since disappeared in other areas of the nation. All the songs we sing here today are versions of songs I have collected within the last 25 years in the Appalachian Mountains and all reflect some aspect of earlier American music.",

Before introducing the material, I would like to give some background.\n\nFirst off, I will explain why I use the words \u2018song\u2019 and \u2018tune\u2019. The difference between a song and a tune is that a song has lyrics and a tune does not. Some tunes have lyrics, which would be a song, but when it is performed without lyrics, it is a tune. This is not uncommon, especially with numbers like \u2018Old Joe Clark'. Personally, I\u2019m not much of a stickler for this, but this is a technicality that some folks take seriously.\n\nMost Appalachian (\u2018app-uh-latch-in\u2019) and Celtic fiddle tunes are structured in an AA-BB format. This means that there are two melodies: the \u2018A\u2019 melody is played twice and the \u2018B\u2019 melody is played twice. This is repeated as long as the group or individual wants. After numerous repetitions, which could be only two or hundreds, the fiddler raises their leg to signify to the rest of the musicians that it is the final round. Other tunes may be structured in AA-BB...  more\ncredits\nreleased October 30, 2022\n\nAll songs and tunes were recorded, at least partially, at The Bomb Shelter, Nashville, TN\n\nEngineers: Drew Carroll (all), Ben Hjertmann (7 & 9), and Andrew Preavett (9)\n\n\u201cOld Joe Clark\u201d - Violin and Tabla recorded at Earhead Recording Studio, Mars Hill, NC\nSpoons recorded at Jonathon\u2019s House\n\n\u201cHouse Carpenter\u201d - Bifur, Tabla, Violin, Whistle, and Throat Singing recorded at Earhead Recording Studio,\nMars Hill, NC\n\nSitar, Hulusi, and Didgeridoo recorded at Breaker 17 Studio, Fort Oglethorpe, GA\n\nMixing Engineer: Drew Carroll (1-7, 9); Luke Craig (8)\n\nMastering Engineer: Anders Peterson at GS Mastering & Post, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nGraphic Design: Atharwa Deshingkar\n\nAlbum art: Karl Paul Themistokles von Eckenbrecher, Public Domain\n\nRecorded May and September 2022\n\n\nAll Tracks in the Public Domain\nArtwork in the Public Domain\nlicense\n",

From August 1881 to August 1883 the expedition, consisting of 25 officers and men, recorded 500 observations each day on weather and tides and collected and studied samples of minerals, flora, and fauna. Discoveries made on sledge trips included Lake Hazen and Greely Fjord on the western side of Ellesmere. When a relief ship failed to arrive in early August 1883 the party abandoned Fort Conger and moved southward in small boats. Covering 500 miles (805 kilometres) in 51 days, the men landed at Bedford Pym Island in Smith Sound on October 15. There they faced a winter of 250 days with rations for 40 days and, before the ordeal was over, were reduced to eating their own leather clothing. Only Greely and six others survived.\n\nBuzz Aldrin.

It\u2019s an exercise that\u2019s well worth the effort,\u201d said Neal Hegarty, vice president of programs at Mott, of the internship experience. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed the experience to give students an opportunity to explore a potential career with philanthropy or the nonprofit sector, but no matter where their careers take them, we hope the internship opens their eyes to the importance of voluntary service in their communities.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s undergraduate students included:\n\nMoNeka Young, a senior at Spellman College majoring in economics, who worked with the Flint Area program.\nKatlyn Koegel, an international studies major from Hope College, who is currently in her senior year.

Matthew is a second-year master\u2019s student at Michigan State University studying Communication.\nWeekly learning sessions with nonprofit, philanthropic and government leaders took place throughout the summer, giving the interns an opportunity to acquaint themselves with different career sectors.  Providing information and exposure to fields ranging from nonprofit law to volunteerism, the sessions also helped them learn more about the complexities and challenges of the work.\n\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ll take away from this experience is the amount of time and effort policy involves and how complicated the process is.

The internship gave me confidence in the workplace,\u201d she said.\n\nA common goal of contributing to the Flint community was a uniting factor among this year\u2019s interns.\n\n\u201cThis experience was a great alignment for me because I want to serve a community that I know has good people in it,\u201d said MoNeka Young, a Flint native who worked with the Foundation\u2019s Flint-area grantmaking team.

        "premise": "Book Review: Eithihyamala (Malayalam), compiled by Kottarathil Sankunni\nPosted on August 18, 2013\nAbout the author:\nKottarathil Sankunni is a well known author in Malayalam Literature. He started compiling the legends of Kerala in 1909 and completed the work over eight volumes and taking nearly a quarter of a century. He died in 1937.\n\nCover and blurb:\nA simple yet elegant and ornate cover with some hieroglyphs or such and a curtain, as if we are being invited into the room of legends, of folklore known and unknown.\n\nMy thoughts:\nReading a book in my native language was always something I had wanted to do. It\u2019s not something that I find easy, being born and brought up elsewhere and not knowing the lingo or even all letters in Malayalam, and I restrict myself to usually newspapers or small magazines at most. So earlier this year, I told myself that I would read a book in Malayalam, and read it completely at that. The book I chose is this one.\n\nAithihyamala, translated to \u201cGarland of Legends\u201d\u2026 it is a book that contains all eight volumes, and over one hundred and twenty legends of Kerala folklore. Not something everyone would be familiar with, but maybe most Malayalis would know of. To read a translation and get the feeling of awe is difficult in itself, so reading it over eight months and in Malayalam was quite exciting.\n\nStories like Kadamatathu Kathanar, the story of the priest of Kadamattom Church, believed to possess supernatural powers, or Kayamkulam Kochunni, the Robin Hood of Kerala highways in the early 19th century are quite famous. Others like the Parayi Petta Pantirukulam, meaning twelve kulams (ethnic groups) born of a pariah woman, and Thiruvattatthadhi Kesavan, an elephant which considered to be auspicious, are not that known, yet interesting. Speaking to another Malayali friend Acchuse, she mentioned the tale of Viddikushmandam as her favorite: it is a story about someone who is thought of as a fool, and rejected by a guru, then years later, that someone returns as a great guru/healer.\n\nThis book is a mixture of entities, you could say, with myriad colors. It has the stories of thieves and kings, vampires and magicians, gods and goddesses and even elephants. When I spoke to my grandmother about the book, she already knew about it, and told me these stories were part of her childhood stories, told as bedtime stories or just for passing time during a rainy afternoon. And after reading these stories, I can\u2019t help but agree. Not sure about it being bedtime stories, some feel a little scary at times, but it feels just right for a rainy afternoon and sharing with young kids.\n\nIf you can read and understand Malayalam, I\u2019d suggest you to try this book sometime. It is really magical and fun. I\u2019m going to have to read it again, as it has not quite sunk in just yet. But 900 pages in Malayalam, that too more of an old school lingo\u2026 well, that\u2019s an achievement of sorts for me already. I\u2019d rate it higher if I could, and this is a perfect book and deserves the perfect rating on my scale.",

Prior to being elected to the Senate, Richter served one term in the Florida House of Representatives, representing a Naples-based district from 2006 to 2008.\n\nHistory\nRichter was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and served in the United States Army from 1969 to 1971, earning a Bronze Star Medal and a Combat Infantry Badge in the process. He then served in the United States Air Force Reserves from 1979 to 1981. Richter attended the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with his bachelor's degree in 1981, and then completed a graduate program at the Graduate School of Banking at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\n\nIn 1987, Richter moved to Florida, where he served on the Greater Naples Chamber of Commerce, the Collier County Education Foundation, the Economic Development Council of Collier County, and Leadership Florida. He was a founding director of the First National Bank of Naples until 1997, when it was acquired by the FNB Corporation. Richter was a founder of and executive at the First National Bank of Florida prior to its acquisition by Fifth Third Bank in 2005. Since 2007, he has worked as the President of the First Florida Integrity Bank.\n\nFlorida House of Representatives\nIncumbent State Representative J. Dudley Goodlette was unable to seek re-election in 2006 due to term limits. Richter ran to succeed him in the 76th District, which stretched from North Naples to Marco Island in western Collier County. Richter was unopposed in the Republican primary, and faced Ken McPherson, the Constitution Party nominee. He was endorsed by the Naples Daily News, which praised his focus on \"affordable housing and insurance as the big issues facing Florida and the Legislature,\" though they noted that \"[s]ome of his goals and positions on key issues could use a tuneup.\"[1] Ultimately, Richter defeated MacPherson handily, winning 78% of the vote to MacPherson's 22%.[2]\n\nFollowing Richter's election to the House, he initially started campaigning to be Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives for the 2012-2014 legislative term, but he withdrew as fellow State Representative Will Weatherford solidified support.[3]\n\nDuring the 2008 legislative session, Richter sponsored legislation with State Senator Michael S. Bennett that would have allowed business owners to purchase commercial property insurance without the threat of assessments from the state.[4]\n\nFlorida Senate\nIn 2008, incumbent State Senator Burt Saunders was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, instead opting to launch a congressional campaign against Congressman Connie Mack IV. Richter ran to succeed him in the 37th District, which included Cape Coral and Fort Myers in Collier and Lee Counties. He was unopposed in both the Republican primary and the general election, and won his first term entirely uncontested.[5]\n\nWhen the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Richter opted to run for re-election in the 23rd District, which contained much of the territory that he had previously represented. As was the case in 2008, Richter did not face an opponent in the primary or general elections and was re-elected without opposition. Upon being re-elected, Richter noted, \"I'm looking forward to continuing my service to the Legislature by advancing sound fiscal policy and continuing to support Governor Scott's agenda for economic growth and private sector job growth.\"[6]\n\nDuring the 2016 legislative session, Richter sponsored legislation that would create a regulatory mechanism for allowing hydraulic fracturing and that would pre-empt local county and municipality bans on fracking.[7]",

Despite playing for 16 clubs in 19 spells the majority of his goals and appearances came at Brentford, Wimbledon, and Bolton Wanderers. He is the twin brother of David Holdsworth.\n\nAs a player, he started his career at Watford in 1986, where he spent three years before signing with Brentford, following a short loan spell. A highly successful three years followed before he was signed by Wimbledon in 1992. After an impressive five-year spell, he transferred to Bolton Wanderers. He spent six years at Bolton, before in 2003 joining Coventry City, Rushden & Diamonds and then back to Wimbledon. In 2004, he signed with Havant & Waterlooville, where he spent one season before joining Derby County as player\u2013assistant manager. In 2006, he dropped out of the Football League for the final time, joining Weymouth. Short spells followed at Heybridge Swifts, Cambridge United, and Newport County.\n\nHis management career started at Redbridge in 2007. After one season there he took the reins at Newport County. In his second season with the club he took them to the Conference South title with 28 points to spare.

He took charge at Chelmsford City in May 2013, before resigning five months later. He returned to management for a five-month spell with Brentwood Town in June 2015. In March 2016, he led a consortium to purchase Bolton Wanderers.\n\nPlaying career\nWatford\nHoldsworth primarily played as a striker, although in the latter part of his career he tended to play off the front man. He was a pacey striker with good shooting ability. He started his career at Watford, who finished ninth in the First Division in 1986\u201387 under Graham Taylor's stewardship, before suffering relegation in 1987\u201388 under Dave Bassett and then Steve Harrison. He was loaned out to Carlisle United towards the end of the campaign, and scored once in four Fourth Division games for Clive Middlemass.[4] He joined John Rudge's Port Vale in March, and scored twice at Vale Park in six Third Division appearances.[4] He started 1988\u201389 on loan at Terry Yorath's Swansea City, and returned to Vicarage Road after one goal in five Third Division games.[4] He then joined Steve Perryman's Brentford on loan, before joining the club permanently for \u00a3125,000 in September 1989.[4]\n\nBrentford\nHe was to prove himself as a prolific goalscorer for the \"Bees\", as the club moved from 13th in 1989\u201390 to the play-offs in 1990\u201391, before Holdsworth scored 38 goals in the Third Division championship winning season of 1991\u201392, in a fruitful partnership with Gary Blissett.[5] For this achievement he was named on the PFA Team of the Year. Phil Holder was unable to keep him at Griffin Park following these exploits.\n\nWimbledon\nHe signed for Joe Kinnear's Wimbledon in the middle of 1992 for \u00a3650,000. He made an immediate impact in his first season at the \"Dons\", becoming the club's top scorer and the Premier League's third highest scorer with 19 goals,[6] after forming a solid partnership with John Fashanu. During his time at Selhurst Park, eccentric club chairman Sam Hammam promised to buy Holdsworth a Ferrari sports car and even a camel if he managed to score 20 league goals in a season. However, Holdsworth never quite managed to reach that target. He hit 17 league and seven cup goals in 1993\u201394, including a hat-trick against Oldham Athletic on 26 April 1994.[6] He was less prolific in 1994\u201395,[7] though Wimbledon still finished in ninth place.

He rediscovered his scoring touch in the First Division, hitting 12 goals in 26 starts in 1998\u201399.[10] He then hit 14 goals from 24 league starts in 1999\u20132000, as Sam Allardyce led Bolton to the semi-finals of the play-offs, the FA Cup and the League Cup.[11] He scored 15 goals from 29 starts in 2000\u201301, including a hat-trick past Scunthorpe United in a 5\u20131 win at the Reebok Stadium.[12] The \"Trotters\" reached the play-off final, and beat Preston North End 3\u20130 at the Millennium Stadium to regain their top-flight status. He was restricted to nine league starts and 22 substitute appearances in 2001\u201302, scoring once each against Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur.[13] He made 10 goalless appearances in 2002\u201303,[14] though was briefly joined in Lancashire by his brother David for the first time since leaving Watford.\n\nLater career\nHe joined Coventry City on loan in December 2002, making six goalless appearances, before he signed permanently for the club the following month.[14] He scored once in the FA Cup against Cardiff City, but failed to find the net in his 11 league games and moved on to Brian Talbot's Rushden & Diamonds on a non-contract basis in March.[14][15] Diamonds topped the Third Division in 2002\u201303, though Holdsworth left Nene Park in the summer. He returned to Wimbledon for the 2003\u201304 campaign, as the club relocated to Milton Keynes. He scored three goals in 28 games in 2003\u201304.[16] He then spent the 2004\u201305 season with Havant & Waterlooville in the Conference South.[17] He then joined Derby County, where he was appointed as assistant manager,[18] but played as a striker during an injury crisis,[19][20] leaving the club when manager Phil Brown was sacked in January 2006. He finished the 2005\u201306 season with spells in non-league football at Weymouth and Heybridge Swifts.[21] Holdsworth returned to Havant & Waterlooville for the opening months of the 2006\u201307 season,[17] before joining Cambridge United in the new year.[4] Holdsworth joined Newport County on a short-term contract in February 2007 and was released by manager Peter Beadle at the end of the 2006\u201307 season,[22] after playing in the 2007 FAW Premier Cup Final defeat to The New Saints.[23]",

        "premise": "Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on\nEnergy, the Environment and Natural Resources\nIssue 14 - Evidence\nOTTAWA, Thursday, December 15, 2011\n\nThe Standing Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources met this day at 8:12 a.m. to study the current state and future of Canada's energy sector (including alternative energy).\n\nSenator W. David Angus (Chair) in the chair.\n\n[English]\n\nThe Chair: Good morning, everyone. Maybe I should say good afternoon. Welcome. This is a regular meeting of the Standing Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources. We continue our study into the energy sector, with a view to developing a strategic framework for a more sustainable, more efficient, cleaner and greener future energy system in this country.\n\nWe have been at this for almost three years now. The committee has just finished two weeks of travelling in the western part of the country, continuing its dialogue with Canadians on these matters of energy, the environment and the economy, all three of which are inextricably intertwined. We are back here with our heads spinning with all kinds of wonderful new data, information and things that we learned in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba in the last two weeks.\n\nThis morning, colleagues, we will have a slightly different perspective on the climate change issue. As you know, we have all heard many things about climate change as it relates to and affects the production and use of energy. We have heard many people say that we need a price on carbon. We have had some lonely voices in the West saying that maybe we should not have a price on carbon. This morning we have invited four distinguished professors who have expertise in climate, in geology and in paleontology. I hope you all have their biographies. I read them all last night.\n\nYou are all distinguished gentleman. Rather than read all your bios, I will trust that my colleagues have had a look at them. Perhaps when you are in the middle of your discussions, or before you begin, you might want to elaborate on your backgrounds.\n\nWe senators, of course, never know whether we will get home for Christmas or stay here to bring the coal over to Mr. Justin Trudeau or any of his colleagues. However, we will try to keep the four witnesses to 10 minutes each and then have questions. I am hoping we will have 15 minutes at the end for an in camera session about our trip and about the way forward.\n\nWithout further ado, I am Senator David Angus, from the province of Quebec. I chair the committee. Here also are Senator Grant Mitchell, the deputy chair, from Alberta; Marc LeBlanc and Sam Banks from the parliamentary library, Senator Richard Neufeld, from British Columbia; a guest with us today, a man who has been hovering on the edges of our committee, a great guru from the northern part of Canada, Senator Dennis Patterson; Senator Bert Brown, from Alberta, Canada's only elected senator at present; our clerk, Lynne Gordon; my predecessor, Senator Tommy Banks, from Alberta; Senator Rob Peterson, from Saskatchewan; the pit bull from Whitehorse, Yukon, Senator Daniel Lang, who is well known to the committee and who is also a welcome guest this morning; and Canada's female athlete of the 20th century, Senator Greene Raine from B.C. She had a bit of a hand in the program this morning, colleagues. She has been following our deliberations and our issues with great interest, debating with me into the wee hours of the morning on issues. I think she made the point that it is good to hear both sides of the story, so that is what we will do. Last but not least, we have, from New Brunswick, Senator John Wallace.\n\nI believe you gentlemen will proceed one after the other.\n\nRoss McKitrick, Professor, Department of Economics, University of Guelph, as an individual: My name is Ross McKitrick. I am a full professor of economics at the University of Guelph, where I specialize in environmental economics. I have published on both the economics of climate change and statistical analysis in climatology. I was an expert reviewer for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fourth Assessment Report, and, in 2006, I was one of 12 experts from around the world asked to brief a panel of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences examining paleo-climate reconstruction methodology.\n\nThe global warming issue is often described with emphatic claims that the science is settled, the situation is urgent and the necessary actions are obvious. The reality is that there are deep disagreements about underlying scientific issues. There is reason to believe the problem has been exaggerated, and most policy proposals simply do not pass objective cost-benefit tests. Amidst the disputes and controversies of the past few years, I believe two points have emerged with clarity.\n\nFirst, the economics of climate change do not favour Kyoto-type commitments. Under current and foreseeable technologies, the greenhouse gas policies that we can afford to undertake would have such small climatic impacts as to be pointless. The same kinds of models that are used to forecast global warming predict that, if all the signatories to the Kyoto Protocol complied with their commitments, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that we would have observed by 2100 would instead have been reached by about 2105, a trivial difference. Kyoto was too costly for countries to reach. When a policy is proposed that is too costly to implement and yields benefits that are too small to measure, you would expect reasonable people to see it as a bad idea. Instead, we observed a dogmatic elite consensus in support of Kyoto. In my mind, this never validated Kyoto; it merely discredited the elite consensus and suggested to me that the international political milieu in charge of the climate issue was unduly susceptible to groupthink.\n\nUnlike such air pollutants as sulphur dioxide and particulates, which Canada has been very successful in reducing, CO2 is not easy to capture. Once captured, there is no obvious way to dispose of it. There appears to be no way to cut CO2 emissions on a large scale without cutting energy consumption and impeding economic activity.\n\nDespite their enthusiasm for embracing targets, policy-makers around the world have not been able to cut CO2 emissions while pursuing economic growth. Simply put, with regard to most climate policy, the cure is worse than the disease.\n\nSecond, the official process for assessing technical and scientific information on climate change for the purpose of advising policy-makers has become untrustworthy due to bias and partisanship. As a member of the expert review team for the last IPCC report, I saw things take place that violated long-standing principles of peer review.\n\nI documented some of them in various publications since 2007, but the issues never received much attention until the fall of 2009, when thousands of emails from top IPCC scientists were leaked onto the Internet. The so-called Climategate emails confirmed the reality of bias and cronyism in the IPCC process. You may not know, but another 5,000 emails were leaked back in November. The news leaks last month provided even more confirmation that climate scientists privately express greater doubts and disagreement about climate science among themselves than is reflected in IPCC reports.\n\nEarlier this year I was asked by the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation to review IPCC procedures and to make recommendations for reform. My report was published last month and includes a foreword written by John Howard, the former Prime Minister of Australia. I have included a copy with my submission. I mainly focus on how the IPCC handled issues with which I have first-hand knowledge, as a contributor to the peer-reviewed literature on the subject, and on the IPCC text on which I worked closely in my capacity as an expert reviewer.\n\nThe IPCC is not a neutral observer of the scientific process. Instead, it has a party line. It is controlled by a relatively small bureau in Geneva, consisting of a small core surrounded by a network of supportive academics and government officials. The oversight body, called the IPCC Plenary Panel, is passive, inattentive and overly deferential to the bureau. In effect, there is no oversight.\n\nThe bureau picks lead authors who share their views. They are routinely placed in the position of reviewing their own work and that of their critics and are free to rule in their own favour. Lead authors are also free to reject reviewer comments, override review editors and even rewrite text after the close of the peer-review process. The combination of bureau control over the selection of lead authors and a toothless peer-review process means that IPCC assessments are guaranteed merely to repeat and reinforce a set of foregone conclusions that make up the party line.\n\nIn my report I document some disturbing cases where the IPCC violated proper peer-review practices. These include manipulating prominent graphs so as to conceal known flaws in the statistical basis of paleo-climate reconstructions and to exaggerate evidence that modern climate change is historically exceptional \u2014 this is the so-called \"hide the decline\" scandal; fabricating a statistical test result to provide a rationale for dismissing published evidence of urbanization-related contamination of the surface temperature record on which key IPCC conclusions were based; waiting until the close of peer review, then removing text that had initially and correctly cautioned readers that the IPCC method of calculating warming trends likely exaggerated their significance and replacing it with unsupported text saying the opposite.\n\nMy report documents these and other incidents that, in my view, suffice to discredit its claims to rigour and objectivity and point to the need for procedural reform. In 2010, the InterAcademy Council reviewed IPCC procedures and drew attention to many of the same problems as my report does. Unfortunately, the IPCC's internal reform process has gone nowhere. I discuss this problem in section 4 of my report.\n\nAt this point, we could simply muddle along for another 20 years enacting more and more costly and wasteful schemes based on the increasingly biased and unreliable guidance of the international climate policy milieu. That would be the easiest course of action, but it would not serve the public interest. The more difficult option would be to begin the hard work of improving the decision-making process itself, starting with reform of the IPCC.\n\nMy published research has led me to believe that the IPCC has overstated the global warming issue. I have shown that the spatial pattern of warming trends in the surface temperature record is strongly correlated with the spatial pattern of industrialization, even though this pattern is not predicted by climate models as a response to greenhouse gases. This indicates that the standard climate data sets likely have a warm bias due to their failure to correct for disturbances of the land surface from urbanization, agriculture and so forth.\n\nI have also shown that climate models predict significantly more warming over the past 30 years in the tropical troposphere than is observed in satellite or weather balloon records. This is a key region for measuring the water vapour feedbacks that control the magnitude of greenhouse warming. Despite this being the region that models say should be warming fastest in response to greenhouse gases, the 50-year balloon record actually shows no positive trend once the effect of ocean circulation changes in the late 1970s are removed from the record. One of the most telling emails in the so- called Climategate 2.0 archive that was released last month involves one IPCC expert warning another that their efforts to finesse this issue by deceptive trend analysis is \"a fool's paradise.\"\n\nToday you have a chance to hear from a number of serious Canadian scientists about work that they and their colleagues have done that also calls into question aspects of the IPCC party line. The fact that you have learned little of what they are about to tell you does not indicate any deficiencies in the research they or their colleagues have done. Instead, it points to the deficiencies in the process that was supposed to have brought this information to your attention long before now.\n\nThe Chair: Professor, thank you for your candour. It was a well-presented outline of the issues without pulling any punches. I want to ask you a question before I go to the next presenter. You keep talking about these leaks and we keep reading about these leaks. I chair a big hospital board, and every morning in Montreal I am reading in the paper about stuff that happened in my board meetings. They say, \"Oh, well, it's a leak.\" Who are these leakers? Do you have any idea?\n\nMr. McKitrick: In the fall of 2009, I was interviewed by the U.K. police because I was living in the U.K. at the time. My conjecture at the time was that it was an accidental disclosure of an archive by the university that had been prepared in response to a freedom of information request. However, there has emerged an individual in the U.K. who is anonymous, who has engineered the second leak and has also released an archive of what looks like at least another 20,000 emails, but it is encrypted. The individual has indicated he is not prepared to release the decryption code. It appears to be a single individual with access to a server at the University of East Anglia. The emails cover a span from the late 1990s up to the fall of 2009. The person clearly understands the issues because he or she has selected according to specific themes that are relevant to climate research.\n\nJust yesterday the U.K. police raided a few bloggers and also issued retention orders to some American Internet providers. They are trying to find out the identity of the person.",

The CJE has its roots in the journal Contributions to Canadian Economics, which began publication in the 1928 and was replaced in 1935 by the Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science (CJEPS). In 1968, CJEPS divided into two parts: The Canadian Journal of Economics and the Canadian Journal of Political Science. The CJE and its forerunners have a long tradition as a leading general interest journal in economics and have published many classic papers in economics including, for example, Paul Samuelson's classic 1939 paper on the gains from trade and early work by Robert Mundell related to optimum currency areas. The CJE seeks to maintain and enhance its position as the leading economics journal based in Canada and as a major internationally recognized journal. It is receptive to high quality papers in any field of economics and from any source. In addition its editors recognize a particular responsibility regarding high quality empirical papers related to the Canadian economy.

        "premise": "The szlachta (Polish: [\u02c8\u0282laxta] \u24d8 endonym, Lithuanian: \u0161l\u0117kta) were the noble estate of the realm in the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth who, as a class, had the dominating position in the state,[1] exercising extensive political rights and power.[2][3][4][5][6][7] Szlachta as a class differed significantly from the feudal nobility of Western Europe.[8][9] The estate was officially abolished in 1921 by the March Constitution.[1]\n\nThe origins of the szlachta are obscure and the subject of several theories.[10]:\u200a207\u200a Traditionally, its members owned land (allods),[11][12][5] often folwarks.[13] The szlachta secured substantial and increasing political power and rights throughout its history, beginning with the reign of King Casimir III the Great between 1333 and 1370 in the Kingdom of Poland[10]:\u200a211\u200a until the decline and end of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. Apart from providing officers for the army, its chief civic obligations included electing the monarch and filling honorary and advisory roles at court that would later evolve into the upper legislative chamber, the Senate. The szlachta electorate[2] also took part in the government of the Commonwealth via the lower legislative chamber of the Sejm (bicameral national parliament), composed of representatives elected at local sejmiks (local szlachta assemblies). Sejmiks performed various governmental functions at local levels, such as appointing officials and overseeing judicial and financial governance, including tax-raising. The szlachta assumed various governing positions, including voivode, marshal of voivodeship, castellan, and starosta.[14]\n\nIn 1413, following a series of tentative personal unions between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, the existing Lithuanian-Ruthenian nobility formally joined the szlachta.[10]:\u200a211\u200a As the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569\u20131795) evolved and expanded territorially after the Union of Lublin, its membership grew to include the leaders of Ducal Prussia and Livonia. Over time, membership in the szlachta grew to encompass around 8% to 15% of Polish-Lithuanian society, which made the membership an electorate that was several times larger than most noble classes in other countries; by contrast, nobles in Italy and France encompassed 1% during the Early modern period.[2][15]\n\nDespite often enormous differences in wealth and political influence, few distinctions in law existed between the great magnates and lesser szlachta.[2] The juridic principle of szlachta equality existed because szlachta land titles were allodial,[11] not feudal, involving no requirement of feudal service to a liege Lord.[5][6] Unlike absolute monarchs who eventually took reign in most other European countries, the Polish king was not an autocrat and not the szlachta's overlord.[5][16] The relatively few hereditary noble titles in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, while in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of old dynasties.[citation needed] During the three successive Partitions of Poland between 1772 and 1795, most of the szlachta began to lose legal privileges and social status, while szlachta elites became part of the nobilities of the three partitioning powers.",

        "premise": "Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s aspiration, like that of other virtuosos, was to have his own works become part of concert repertoires and emphasise the virtuoso character of his own performances. This is why his first compositions \u2013 Caprices Op. 3 and Op. 10, Polonaises Op. 6 and 9, Variations Op. 2, 4 and 5, as well as Rondo alla polacca Op. 7 and 13 that were intended for classroom exercises \u2013 were geared towards displaying feats of extraordinary skill. Over the course of 1821, Lipi\u0144ski performed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, Berlin, Leipzig and Wroc\u0142aw. He then returned to Lviv to plan his next concert tour, which included performances in Vilnius (May 1822). The tour also took him to Kiev, Pozna\u0144 (June 1823) and Krak\u00f3w (June 1824). In 1825, Lipi\u0144ski gave concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The following year was also very busy. At the end of 1827, Lipi\u0144ski arrived in Warsaw, where he played six times during his nearly three-month stay. Maurycy Mochnacki wrote several reviews of his performances and noticed that \u2018the characteristic feature of Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s music is its picturesque style, comprehensibility, precision and lyrical elation\u2019.[3] During his stay in Warsaw, Lipi\u0144ski received an important distinction and was declared the \u2018First Violinist at the Court of the Kingdom of Poland\u2019. Having visited Kiev for a spell in 1829, he returned to Lviv, where he received honorary citizenship. He returned to Warsaw in the same year, where he was to play concerts in June. At the same time, Paganini performed in Warsaw. Critics were divided into two opposing camps, each of them praising one virtuoso and reviling the other. There were some unflattering comments concerning Lipi\u0144ski in the press, but this awkward situation did not affect the friendly relations between the two geniuses.\n\nThe joint performances with Paganini and the dispute over who should be hailed as the consummate virtuoso of the violin contributed to the increase of Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s popularity, who, however, did not take advantage of his growing fame, because he did not set off on a tour to Paris straight away: ultimately, he understood that Paganini\u2019s unrivalled and frantic virtuoso technique was not crucially important for interpreting music, but became an end in itself, an impressive acrobatic feat devised to amaze the audience.\n\nLate in 1830, news came to Lviv about the uprising against the Tsar that had broken out in Warsaw. The insurgents, however, were soon defeated, much to Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s despair. It was then that his interest in Polish and Ukrainian folklore came to the fore, as can be seen in the piano accompaniment to The Polish and Russian songs of the Galician people collected by the poet Wac\u0142aw Zaleski, known also by his penname Wac\u0142aw of Olesko. At the end of 1833, the composer resumed his artistic tours and gave concerts in Vilnius, Warsaw, Pozna\u0144 and Gda\u0144sk. Then he set off for Leipzig, Frankfurt am Main and Paris. In Leipzig, he met Robert Schumann, who wrote: \u2018Lipi\u0144ski is here. These three words are enough for a music lover to set his pulse racing \u2026 For those who have not yet heard the powerful violin master, who is so adept at ushering one into the realm of previously unfamiliar feelings, it is recommended that they pay attention to this special opportunity to relish in his art as this is going to be a musical performance they may not experience in years\u2019.[4] As a token of his affection, Schumann dedicated the series of piano works known as Carnival to Lipi\u0144ski.\n\nIn Paris, Karol met a number of friends: Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Adam Mickiewicz, Bohdan Zaleski, Karol Sienkiewicz and Ignacy Chod\u017ako, and, most significantly, Fryderyk Chopin, whom he met when still in Warsaw, as well as Giacomo Meyerbeer, whose operas were high on the agenda of Paris opera theatres at the time. The successive concert tours took Lipi\u0144ski to London, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Wroc\u0142aw and Vienna, where the Viennese audience compared him with Paganini and Ole Bull. However, one particular review (by M. G. Saphir, an editor of the daily newspaper Der Humorist) seems to be especially evocative: \u2018violin music is a battle ground between Romanticism and Classicism. Paganini has become representative of Romanticism on account of his stunning ingenuity and the extraordinary and charming style of his performances. Lipi\u0144ski, by contrast, is a genius of Classicism. It is in him that we find peace in its perfected and fully mature form, the sort of peace that is in itself the primary feature, flower and fruit of inner perfection. In Paganini\u2019s music we forget about art for the sake of the artist, while in Lipinski\u2019s the artist is being forgotten for the sake of art. We admire Paganini\u2019s violin, but it is Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s violin that we love\u2019.[5] After some time that proved to be fairly tumultuous to him, having completed a number of tours, Karol Lipi\u0144ski became the director-concertmaster of the music ensemble at the royal court of Saxony in Dresden in mid-1838. His duties also included solo performances to the accompaniment of the orchestra and taking care of music performed at religious ceremonies. At that time, Lipi\u0144ski also nurtured his passion for chamber music: the string quartet he founded focused on performing works by the Viennese classical composers.\n\nPaganini died on 27 May 1840, having bequeathed eight of his best violins listed in his will to the eight most eminent violinists in Europe (Lipi\u0144ski received his Amati instrument).\n\nIn 1842, Richard Wagner was one of the first visitors to the newly created opera theatre in Dresden. Lipi\u0144ski greatly esteemed his talent. It was not long before Wagner became the second artistic director of the Dresden Opera. The then concertmaster of the opera orchestra was Lipi\u0144ski, who disagreed with the Bayreuth master over his interpretation of Mozart\u2019s Don Giovanni. The conflict, however, was soon resolved and had no negative impact on their collaboration.\n\nIn the following years, Lipi\u0144ski played innumerable concerts all around Europe, which only added to his already well-established fame; it is not surprising, therefore, that scores of young violinists would come to him to become his apprentices, since he was noted not only for his mastery of the violin, but also for his exceptional pedagogical talent. Among his numerous students was one indisputable genius, Henryk Wieniawski. Lipi\u0144ski took care of him in a fatherly manner (he was only thirteen at the time) and recommended him to another virtuoso musician, the pianist Ferenc Liszt.\n\nLipi\u0144ski\u2019s last tour took him to Kiev in 1846. In 1854, he received the knight\u2019s cross of the Albert Order in recognition of his merit to the royal court.\n\nThe year 1856 saw the death of Regina, Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s wife. The composer was devastated by this loss and fell ill in the following year, suffering from rheumatism. He was experiencing a malfunction of his right arm and wrist, which significantly limited his ability to work. He underwent treatment at the spas of Cieplice and Karlsbad, but although it did alleviate his suffering, he was unable to return to concertmaster\u2019s duties. Considering this, in 1860 Lipi\u0144ski applied to his employer (L\u00fcttichau) for a pension. In 1861, he moved from Dresden to Ur\u0142\u00f3w (now Virliv in Ukraine), where he died on 16 December of that year following a severe asthma attack. His body was laid to rest next to that of his wife in the family tomb in Ur\u0142\u00f3w.\n\nWhen in Ur\u0142\u00f3w, Lipi\u0144ski tried to set up a music school for poor peasant children. He also wanted to fund scholarships for Polish violinists, but all these plans were left unfinished and it was only owing to his son Gustaw that they were finally implemented after his death. Being the only heir of the Ur\u0142\u00f3w estate and having no descendants, Gustaw Lipi\u0144ski stated in his will that the proceeds from the sale of the estate should be divided into four parts, three of which were to fund the Karol and Regina Lipi\u0144ski scholarships for three Polish violinists studying at Lviv, Naples and Vienna conservatories,[6] provided that the scholarship holders performed at least one of his father\u2019s works at every examination. A fourth part of the proceeds was to secure the upkeep of the family tomb. The will proved to be troublesome for the executor, i.e. the regional assembly of Galicia (under Austrian administration), as Lviv did not have a conservatory, but only the music school maintained by the Galician Music Society. This, however, was resolved by transforming the school into a conservatory.\n\nLipi\u0144ski\u2019s artistic oeuvre and techniques of composition\n\nThe works of Karol Lipi\u0144ski are dominated by instrumental works, with a privileged role reserved for the violin, as can be seen in the overture to the opera K\u0142\u00f3tnia przez zak\u0142ad (\u2018The Quarrel over a Bet\u2019), in which the violin plays the role of the concertante instrument. It is obvious that Lipi\u0144ski composed his works having himself in mind as their intended performer, and, given his matchless technical skill, it is hardly surprising that his compositions often contained two-pitched sonorities and three-voice and four-voice structures. To shape his own works, Lipi\u0144ski often used the form of sonata-allegro that was fairly casual, closely reminiscent of fantasy. The idiomatic features of Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s music include a truly remarkable melodic ingenuity, simple and clear harmony interspersed with occasional chromatic elements and folk dance rhythmic patterns.\n\nA significant part of the composer\u2019s legacy consists of compositions prepared for a variety of occasions, as well as variations and fantasies based on themes from Italian operas or from his own opera works. They had a showpiece character and involved the typical compositional means that were commonly employed in that period, but because of their low degree of individualization they soon passed into oblivion.\n\nAmong Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s most valued works are concerts, caprices, polonaises and rondos, musical forms that were especially appreciated by his contemporaries and often performed in concert halls. The concerts are particularly interesting, modelled as they are on those by Spohr. The first two have a three-part structure, whereas the other two are standalone compositions. The caprices are especially challenging on account of their technical intricacy, as they require masterful command of such virtuoso elements as arpeggio, passages spanning perfect and augmented octaves, flageolets and acrobatic portamenti.\n\nIn his youth, Lipi\u0144ski composed symphonies, too. His Symphony in E flat major and Symphony in B flat major have a four-movement structure, while the Symphony in C major is made up of three parts. All of them, much in the vein of Haydn\u2019s symphonies, begin with slow movements. The first and the final parts are composed in the form of sonata-allegro. These works were intended for small orchestral ensembles.\n\nAll opera works by Lipi\u0144ski written for the Polish Theatre in Lviv were in fact short vaudevilles and followed the contemporary models of theatrical performance. Their comic and \u2018light\u2019 character made them especially appealing.\n\n  The national idiom in Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s music\n\n In the nineteenth century and beyond, when the Polish lands were partitioned between the neighbouring powers, the wanderings of musicians were the norm. They would give concerts in various European cities, often displaying their nationality through their music. Karol Lipi\u0144ski was a sought-after virtuoso violinist, soon to become a living legend. Beginning with his earliest years, he absorbed the musical atmosphere of Lviv and showed interest in the folklore of the Lviv region. The regional motifs in Violin Concerto No. 2 in D major Op. 21, dating from 1826, paved the way for the concert to be included into the category of \u2018military concerts\u2019, which means that the clashes of 1809, when Napoleon\u2019s troops briefly stationed in Lviv, were engraved on the young composer\u2019s memory. Also, in Violin Concerto No. 4 in A major Op. 32, Lipi\u0144ski returned to the military march with its counterpointed and syncopated rhythms. As V. Grigoriev wrote, Lipi\u0144ski made his music part of the native musical idiom owing to his \u2018Slavic melodious tones\u2019, \u2018Polish and West-Ukrainian musical phrasing\u2019, his \u2018technique of improvisation\u2019, \u2018encircling the main elements of melody\u2019, \u2018vivid ornamentation\u2019 and \u2018the characteristically Slavic chromatic embellishments and changes in tonality\u2019.[7]\n\nIn turn, Mieczys\u0142awa Demska-Tr\u0119bacz wrote that \u2018the polonaise has been a dance of freedom at least since the Napoleonic times; it has often served as a manifestation of Polishness\u2019.[8] For this reason, polonaise rhythms feature very prominently in Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s compositions, including in those that are entitled polonaises (Op. 1, 6 and 9), in rondos alla polacca (Op. 7, 13 and 17) and in the Fantasy on a theme of the \u2018Ko\u015bciuszko Polonaise\u2019. The polonaise was supposed to represent the righteousness of the national heroes, as it epitomised respect for tradition and loyalty to the homeland. The rhythm and melodious phrases of the polonaise soon became a subdued non-verbal symbol of Polishness (although readily recognisable to Polish patriots). However, it would be incomplete to limit the national idiom in Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s oeuvre only to the realm of folklore, given that the traditional cult of the Virgin Mary was also part of that idiom.[9] Evidence for this is Lipi\u0144ski\u2019s draft entitled Boga Rodzica. A hymn of St. Adalbert, whose melodic features are modelled on old Polish traditions. It seems likely that it was a fragment of his Variations on Polish melodies for violin and piano, in which the composer grappled with Poland\u2019s national tradition.\n\n\u2018Thus, it was with the national idiom that Lipi\u0144ski had delineated the topos koinos \u2013 the \u2018common\u2019 place \u2013 of Polish violin music. His virtuoso ideas gave rise to a wave of emotions: a soliloquy in the lyrical parts and the resonant voice of the protagonist in the dramatic ones \u2026 Lipi\u0144ski added \u2018violin plaques\u2019, or perhaps \u2018slabs of the most beautiful stone\u2019, to the trove of human culture, preserving the memory of the history of Poland for posterity. They have maintained their invigorating power of generating and co-creating violin music all around the world to this day\u2019.[10]",

Although academic interest in organizational resilience has steadily grown in recent years, there is little consensus about what resilience actually means and how it is composed. More knowledge is particularly needed about organizational capabilities that constitute resilience, as well as conditions for their development. This paper aims to make a contribution to this heterogeneous research field by deepening the understanding of the complex and embedded construct of organizational resilience. We conceptualize resilience as a meta-capability and decompose the construct into its individual parts. Inspired by process-based studies, we suggest three successive resilience stages (anticipation, coping, and adaptation) and give an overview of underlying capabilities that together form organizational resilience. Based on this outline, we discuss relationships and interactions of the different resilience stages as well as main antecedents and drivers. We formulate propositions that can act as a foundation for future empirical work.",

Huggins comes to Kentucky State after spending the past year as the assistant coach of wide receivers at NCAA DI school McNeese State University.\n\n\u201cSeveral qualified candidates were interested in becoming the next head football coach at KSU.

In his six years with the team, the Panthers ranked top five in the conference in the total offense all but one year and finished as high as second in 2017 when they averaged 408.6 yards per game.\n\nDuring the 2013 season, the Panthers\u2019 receivers broke or tied all of the team\u2019s receiving records. Sophomore Marsalis Jackson was named the USA South Offensive Rookie of the Year after setting school records of 902 receiving yards and 12 touchdown receptions. Freshman Ervens Oge (713) and junior Griffin Roelle (675) also broke the previous season\u2019s record for receiving yards in a season (450).\n\nIn 2014, Huggins saw senior receiver Griffin Roelle earn USA South All-Conference honors. Rolle broke his own single season record with 67 pass receptions and graduated as the Panthers\u2019 leading receiver with 126 receptions.\n\nHuggins played collegiately at Southeastern Louisiana University. He started for three years and finished his collegiate career as the career leader in receptions (162) and receiving yards (2,350). He still holds school records for catches in a season (84) and receiving yards in a season (1,313). In addition, Huggins is tied for the most catches in a game (13) and has the single game receiving yards record of 266. He received third-team All-America, and All-Conference honors his junior and senior years.\n\nHuggins made his collegiate debut at Grambling State University, where numerous family members attended.\n\nHuggins played six seasons of professional football between the Jacksonville Jaguars, Frankfurt Galaxy, Buffalo Bills and Montreal Alouettes.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I want to thank my lord and savior, Jesus Christ, because none of this would be possible without him. Words can\u2019t describe how excited I am for this opportunity to lead KSU football into this next phase. My journey to this point has not always been easy, but my journey molded me for this moment. I\u2019m ready to pour my all into our players, school and community and bring a championship back to KSU,\u201d said Huggins.\n\n\u201cWhat I am looking to bring to this program is to foster a culture of developing high-character individuals and leaders in the community, in the classroom, and on the playing field through our core values. The foundation of our core values will be based on faith, family, football and fun.\u201d",

We summarize quantitative studies of age-related differences in singing and describe which song characteristics change with age. Patterns of changes are different within and across species. Several song characteristics do not change with age. Others change considerably between year 1 and 2, without further changes in later years. Some measures change gradually from year to year throughout life. After addressing how these patterns might reflect methodological differences, we review mechanisms of age-related changes in singing. We conclude that plasticity in adult singing is a widespread phenomenon, but we are far from understanding the development of song characteristics across individuals' life courses.",
